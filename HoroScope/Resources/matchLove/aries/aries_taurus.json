{"content":"Your enthusiasm can help to perk up the sometimes-lazy Taurus. You Aries are ruled by fiery Mars and tend to be more restless than your Taurus partner, who is ruled by the love planet, Venus. It may be necessary for you to take the lead on many activities.\nOn the other hand, your bull-headed Taurus friend is more persevering than you'll ever be, and will likely bring tenacity and endurance to the relationship. You are the hot-headed and impulsive one, but the Moon in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) or water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) in your chart may mellow you out.\nYour mate may not often lose their temper, but when they do, you'd better watch out! Both of you can be reactionary and somewhat childlike in your response to authority and leadership. When it comes to play, however, the two of you can romp and roam the fields of life. Slow down, Aries, and you'll be able to enjoy this relationship for a long time to come.\n"}
