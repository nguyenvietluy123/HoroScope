{"content":"You project yourself with willpower and sheer passion. Your deep emotional intensity can help you achieve almost anything you seek to accomplish. You have the ability to draw upon hidden sources of power to attain your ends.\nYour Aries partner is aggressive and hard driving, motivated by a strong need for excitement and independence. Both signs are ruled by the planet Mars, the Greek god of war, and are therefore endowed with personal willpower and courage. You can endure intense emotions by holding them inward and transforming them from the inside out. Your lover, on the other hand, has a shorter fuse and tends toward outbursts and sudden fits of impatience. Compared to your pensive and sometimes sullen personality, he or she is quicker to forgive and forget than you are.\nAries' short temper and your resentful and sometimes unforgiving personality mix like oil and water. In conflict or competition, your partner can win in the opening rounds, but cannot sustain a position against you, who will win in the long run.\n Of course, if this energy is converted to sexual interactions, the power unleashed can rock both your worlds. Your chances for success will be greatly increased if the Moon in your chart is in a fire or air sign, lightening your emotional load. Additionally, if your Mercury or Venus is in Sagittarius, then you won't feel so overwhelmed by the heat of your impulsive Aries mate.\nIf the two of you can move toward a higher consciousness and get beyond the personality traps of your individual signs, you'll have a chance to create a long-lasting relationship full of powerful love and passion.\n"}
