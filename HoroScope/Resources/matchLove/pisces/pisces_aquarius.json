{"content":"You are so sensitive that you can actually feel other people's emotions. When you hook up with an Aquarian, at first it seems like you two are so very different, your reality is emotional; his or hers is intellectually detached. You may be quite compatible in philosophy, but different in your style of execution.\nAquarius folks are interested in things beyond their individual lives, being idealistic and concerned with all of humanity. You are aware of global suffering and pain, and Aquarius wants to do something about it. You are both evolved and aligned with a higher understanding, and try to bring love and tenderness into your personal relationships, yet with a non-personal edge. You are both probably interested in organizations that promote service and goodwill, and may even meet while participating in one of these programs, in a circle of friends or at school.\nYour emotional world coupled with your Aquarius lover's mental emphasis creates a need within the relationship to balance the intuitive and intellectual sides of your natures. If Venus in your chart is in Aries-or better yet-in Aquarius, you will adapt more easily to life with an emotionally cool Aquarius. If the Moon or Mars in your chart is in an Air Sign, chances for compatibility are improved even more.\nMost likely, the two of you will be focused on greater needs than just yourselves. Therefore, if raising children, you may encourage a broad spectrum of educational topics in order to magnify awareness about the world-at-large. There can be a strong bond between you two that goes deeper than the eye can see with a harmonious resonance on a very high note. Others may not see what you have, but this can be a good match if you both strive for awareness and stay on a spiritual path.\n"}
