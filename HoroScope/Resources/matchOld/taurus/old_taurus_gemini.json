{"content":"Taurus-Gemini Compatibility \nA steady pace makes Taurus to always be ahead in life. Taurians are very calm and have a great peace at mind. On the other hand, Geminians lose stability. Gemini individuals are mostly restless in nature. These opposite characteristics may sometimes create problems in their relationship. But, that will not make the relationship tattered. If Taurus tries to learn to compromise from Gemini and Gemini learns consistency from Taurus then compatibility problems can be kept at bay. \n\nTaurus Man and Gemini Woman \nA Gemini woman is easily attracted by the self-confidence and never-ending energy of a Taurus man. She will instantly fall for him. But the longevity of this relationship is not certain according to astrology. Her vivacious nature may get throttled by his possessiveness. He will want her to be less wild in her behaviour as they move towards settling in life. This will be an excellent match provided they manage to reconcile their differences.\n\nTaurus Woman and Gemini Man \nTaurus woman feels jealous and possessive because of the flirtatious nature of Gemini man. He may find a dearth of sense of adventure in her. Taurus woman is always concerned with security and commitment whereas a Gemini man is restless and hyperactive. Ganesha advises both of them to have a lot of understanding to live in this relationship. And to forget about watching late night films and having candle lit dinners.\n"}
