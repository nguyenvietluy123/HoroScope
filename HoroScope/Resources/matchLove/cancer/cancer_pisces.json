{"content":"You and Pisces are like two peas in a pod and can live together in a garden of eternal happiness. You Crabs plunge right into the deep waters of emotion and feeling with ease and grace. Your fishy friend swims the currents of the soul with sensitive awareness and compassion. The two of you share an intimate link that transcends the boundaries of the intellect. It seems like you don't even need words. You understand each other deeply.\nIn a way you are zodiac cousins, for the Crab and the Fish live in the same watery world. Your intuitive lover is tuned into your changing moods and your emotional needs. Meanwhile, you are acutely aware of the existential pain and suffering residing within your sometimes confused partner. If, however, your Venus is in Gemini, as it is for many Cancers, you may not be as understanding of your spiritual lover. In this case you may see their compassion as weakness rather than strength.\nEven with a compatible Venus, one problem you might face in this relationship is that when things get tough, you tend to withdraw. Your tendency to hold back when talking about your feelings allows for misunderstandings to easily arise. You absolutely must communicate your feelings or the relationship may be doomed to shipwreck on the rocks. Get past your fears and together you will ebb and flow in the emotional waters of life's pleasure and pain with forgiveness and joy.\n"}
