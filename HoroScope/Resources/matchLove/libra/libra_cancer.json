{"content":"You have high ideals in your relationships and seek to understand your partner as a means to broaden your own self-reflection and identity. Therefore, you may assume a mental stance in a relationship, which is not problematic unless you are with a water sign, such as Cancer. Your Cancer lover is a deeply emotional and highly sensitive person who may be overwhelmed and even perplexed by your detached style.\nYour Crab prefers to feel their way through a situation, nourishing and protecting those they love with a giving and open heart. No question about it: you appreciate this devotion. On the other hand, you may feel burdened, even claustrophobic, by the always present and sometimes unspoken needs of insecure Cancer lover, unless the Moon or Venus in your chart is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces).\nYour partner is addicted to the comfort of feeling that comes through mutual sharing and commitment. Meanwhile, you want to understand and think about the prospect of mutual union, yet in the end, the actual commitment and steadfast concentration may waver. Needless to say, this will irritate your mate.\nIf you can work out this difference of character, you should be able to love each other with care and respect as you create a life together.\n"}
