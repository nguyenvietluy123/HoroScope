{"content":"You Scorpios have a keen sense of financial strategy, preferring to manage their money matters with a dignified intelligence. You can be brutally truthful and have great integrity in the business world, no matter what the cost.\nWhen you combine your street savvy and management capabilities with the optimistic and truth-oriented Sagittarius, there is tremendous chemistry and mutual respect. The biggest conflict is that your intuition is emotionally based and you've learned how to trust your feelings, but your Sagittarius partner shoots from the hip and can be ready to swing into action with enthusiasm riding roughshod over your objections.\nSagittarius can become impatient with your need to process emotions. On the other hand, you'll grow weary of your lover's avoidance of unpleasant or dark feelings. You want to go there and process them. He or she wants to avoid them at all cost.Your chance for optimum compatibility is improved if the Moon in your chart is in a fire sign or air sign.\nSagittarians are active and adventurous. They are inspiring as they blaze trails into the future and off into the distance with irrepressible confidence and self-esteem. You can reap some benefits in a relationship with a loving Sagittarius mate whose natural character is one of vision and goodwill. He or she can offer humor to your sometimes overly serious ways. Meanwhile, you add intensity and passion to the relationship as you push your Archer into deeper emotional, spiritual and philosophical realms.\nAllowing for differences of style, you can make a success of this combination and complement each other very well.\n"}
