{"content":"Scorpio-Aquarius Compatibility \nScorpio and Aquarius compatibility as measured by Ganesha cannot reach a high level unless they give some space to each other. Aquarians have the tendency to get irritated very easily. Scorpions are dominating and cannot tolerate Aquarian's mood-swings and love for freedom. Scorpions are also emotionally demanding and Aquairians will find it difficult to live up to their expectations. If there is any glue at all that can keep these two zodiac signs together, it may be their physical relationship.\n\nScorpio Man and Aquarius Woman \nAquarius woman seeks pleasure in outdoor activities whereas a Scorpio man wants her to pay attention in household activities. There will always be a clash between the two but an Aquarius woman with her caring and kind nature will try to make this relationship easy-going to some extent. Ganesha wonders if it is possible for the duo to spend rest of the life peacefully. This couple is not a made for each other.\n\nScorpio Woman and Aquarius Man \nThe relationship may have to face a lot of hardships as an Aquarius man is unpredictable and a Scorpio woman is very emotional and demanding. They are very strong and firmly stick to their words. She expects a lot from her partner and if not receiving the same can turn this relationship upside-down. To make this relationship successful, a Scorpio woman has to cool her temperament down and accept the man as he is, without much expectations.
