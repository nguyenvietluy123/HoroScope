{"content":"You pioneering Aries get along famously with inventive and progressive Aquarius as long as the know-it-all tendency of the Aquarius doesn't ignite your hot-headedness into an argument. You need plenty of room for independence and the good news is that airy Aquarius needs enough emotional detachment that you'll be able to have the freedom you need within this relationship.\nBoth of you enjoy new beginnings, the excitement of starting over and enthusiastically sharing your dreams with each other. There is rarely a dull moment in this relationship, unless there are other planetary indicators in your charts, such as Venus, Mars or the Moon in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn).\nThe question between you two might be: \"Who is going to become the more stable one?\"  Both of you can be sure-footed, courageous, and mentally equipped to take on the world. With purpose and determination, the two of you could uplift those around you with new perspectives and opinions about life.\n"}
