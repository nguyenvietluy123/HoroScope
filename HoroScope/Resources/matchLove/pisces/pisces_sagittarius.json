{"content":"You are, by birthright, a true visionary with an active imagination that stimulates your desire to be of service to all beings on the planet. You are naturally attuned to the conditions of life that create suffering in the world, and are often found in jobs that attend to these concerns. You may find it a challenge to implement your ideas into action, for you can get caught up in your own dream world that is difficult to cultivate.\nAll that changes when you meet a goal-oriented Sagittarius, who is most happy when pursuing a long-held dream. Sagittarians are able to work tangibly with their ideas and to bring them into manifestation. Like you, they are idealists and not afraid to commit to a greater cause. Although there can be problems between you because your styles are so different, you can assist each other a great deal. A Sagittarius partner can help you bring your dreams into action while you are able to fuel him or her with an abundance of imaginative material with which to work.\nTogether you'll have a good sense of humor and you'll appreciate the undying optimism of your inspirational mate. Sagittarians can be self-righteous and problems can surface if you feel like your lover isn't taking you seriously. Granted, he or she may be more skilled at working in the outer realms, but this should not make you feel less competent at what you do best. If, however, the Moon or Mars in your chart is in an earth sign, you may have more of a practical lean and this won't be a problem. If your Venus is in Aries, compatibility is increased. Regardless of other planetary placements, you two will need to find innovative ways to fulfill your dreams and goals.\nThis can be an excellent union if you each allow the other room enough to bring their true gifts to the relationship without undue judgment.\n"}
