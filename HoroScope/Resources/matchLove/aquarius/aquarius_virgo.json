{"content":"You are community-oriented with a strong desire to express your intellectual interests that will, in some way, pave the way to a better future. You may find yourself involved with organizations or institutions that hold concern for the greater needs of humanity. Intelligent and friendly, you have strong values and are happiest if life is imbued with purpose and integrity. Your Virgo lover is connected to the planet Mercury, and is also intellectually astute in the observation of the higher needs of the community and the world-at-large. Highly efficient and well organized Virgos appeal to your keen mental abilities.\nThis is a relationship that begins and stays on a mental plane. Even the physical act of making love is first and foremost a mental activity for the two of you and if you cannot do it in your mind and if you cannot talk about it with each other, than it may not be satisfactory.\nOne of the conflicts you face is how differently you each approach life. You are driven by originality and invention, offering new ideas and insight into all endeavors. Your Virgo is driven by accuracy and precision, focusing more on the details than the broad concepts. You may seem odd and quirky to your down-to-earth lover. He or she will most probably seem too caught up in the practical limitations of your best ideas and you may tire of the criticism, however well-intended it may be.\nIf Mercury or Venus in your chart is in Capricorn, your chances for compatibility are improved. With your Moon in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn), you'll be better equipped to understand the needs of your Virgo lover.\nThis can be a productive and well-intentioned relationship as long as you can learn to accept your partner's need for analysis and detail.\n"}
