{"content":"Libra-Cancer Compatibility \nLibrans are harmonious and cheerful people whereas Cancerians are moody and emotional. They may not be able to fulfil each other's requirements as they both have different needs. Librans enjoy social gatherings and adventures whereas Cancerians love to be at home and need privacy. The love and romance between a Cancerian and a Libran may not be intense as Cancers are very emotional and expect caring and cuddling from their counterpart but Librans are practical and may not understand the concern of a Cancerian. \n \nLibra Man and Cancer Woman \nAccording to Astrology, when two zodiac signs bond together, the compatibility factor plays a vital role in defining their destiny together. And, the union of a Cancer woman with a Libra man may not reach the highest levels of compatibility. The Cancer woman in her search for love and support, keeps nagging and whining to the Libra man. And hence the Libra man may get frustrated and annoyed. Since, the couple has different needs, Ganesha cannot declare them as a perfect couple. \n\nLibra Woman and Cancer Man \nThe match of a Cancer man and a Libra woman may not work-out. The problem will lie in their lack of concern for each other. On one hand, a Libra woman is spendthrift whereas a Cancer man is money oriented. Cancer man is very emotional and sensitive but a Libra woman is very easygoing and carefree. This match may not sustain on a permanent basis. But Ganesha also feels that if both the zodiac signs are mature enough then the bond should not be too fragile to break off.\n"}
