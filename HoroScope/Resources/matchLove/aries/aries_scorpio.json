{"content":"You Aries can burn on the hot side and with a Scorpio you may have met your match. Passion is the common thread that intertwines you in this relationship.\nYour Scorpio partner's fire is deep, relentless and consuming. Meanwhile, your fire blazes brightly with sheer excitement and then tends to settle down as you recharge your batteries. Can your emotional and moody Scorpio mate keep up with your outward expression of enthusiasm and joy? Perhaps. But you'll have to learn the virtue of solid commitment and understand the fact that you are in it for the long haul.\nIf Venus in your chart is in Pisces, you'll better appreciate the feeling dimensions of your Scorpio lover. In fact, compatibility is enhanced if your Moon is in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces).\nYou can teach your Scorpio how to have a more lighthearted attitude toward life. He or she can put you in touch with the power of your own passion. Together, you are intense and focused, and will need plenty of time to dive into the pools of intimacy and to explore the mysterious and pleasurable realms of love.\n"}
