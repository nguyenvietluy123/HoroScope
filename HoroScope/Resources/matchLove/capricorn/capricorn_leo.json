{"content":"You are practical and hard working with little interest in frivolous fanfare. You are motivated to do your work, accomplish the tasks at hand, and earn a living in order to secure your position for future gain.\nWhen you meet Leos, you are inclined to question the ways they draw attention to themselves. They can seem to be overly dramatic, showy and outwardly too expressive for your reserved tastes. The Leo's attitude can build barriers between you, for Leo needs and wants love that is tangible, demonstrative, and personal. You may lose patience with your Lion's need for what seems like nearly constant approval and admiration.\nIn the beginning of this union, your Leo lover may generously give affection and gifts to you, hoping for reciprocation and love in return. Later, as the relationship advances beyond the romantic stage, your Lion has been wounded by your lack of fiery romantic demonstration, and may pull away and sulk. He or she will need to come to grips with the fact that you are practical and levelheaded, and may not respond with the adoration your Leo had wanted.\nIf you have Mars in a fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius) or if your Mercury is in Sagittarius, your chances for happiness with a Leo are greatly improved.\nIf this relationship has a destiny, both of you must strive to be self-aware. Because of your differences in life styles, you will each need to give freely, even eagerly, to the other without expectation or demands.\n"}
