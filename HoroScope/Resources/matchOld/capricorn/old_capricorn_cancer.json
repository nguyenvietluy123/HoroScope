{"content":"Capricorn-Cancer Compatibility \nThere are many qualities which are similar in both, a Cancer and a Capricorn but also there are qualities that contradict each other. So, it is difficult to say, whether the love match of a Cancer with a Capricorn is for good or it is the other way round. Capricorn are reliable and loyal but their extreme emotions and mood changes will make him complete grumpy. There also exists good romantic chemistry between them but a lot of affection cannot be expected from a Capricorn. \n \nCapricorn Man and Cancer Woman \nA Capricorn man is very ambitious and hard-headed person and may be more attracted by the higher position or authority rather than a Cancer woman's love. The feelings like emotions, passion and devotion are not the traits of a Capricorn man. A Cancer woman may also find it very hard to teach these qualities to him. Although a Capricorn man may be responsible and loyal but may not find happiness with a Cancer woman as long as he will not spend quality time with her and understand her feelings. \n\nCapricorn Woman and Cancer Man \nThe love line of a Cancer man and a Capricorn woman may not meet very easily. However, in the initial stage of love, both will be attracted towards each other. But, a Cancer man's changing mood and tender nature may frustrate a Capricorn woman who is short tempered and determined. According to Astrology, both the zodiac signs may not head in the same direction but if a Cancer man and a Capricorn woman have trust upon each other, there life boat can sail smoothly.\n"}
