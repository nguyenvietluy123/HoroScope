{"content":"You are very strong within your own self, even if you present a timid appearance. As such, you are not apt to need outside encouragement on a daily basis. And, because you have a sharp mind, you can be self-critical to a fault. You have, however, an uncanny endurance that gets you through most obstacles. Your sharp mind is connected to your sharp eye, and as such you can be overly critical of others, too. This doesn't fly with your Leo mate. The Lion cannot easily take criticism and may be in need of ongoing praise and attention, displaying strengths in other areas, such as devotion, love and generosity.\nYour quiet humility may bump heads with the prideful Lion, who needs outward displays of affection to strengthen self-confidence and courage. If your chart has the Moon, Mercury or Venus in Leo, you'll be able to assimilate these Lion-like traits, using candor and humor to get around the irritations you may feel.\nYour Leo lover can appreciate your razor-sharp wit, but whatever you do, don't tease him or her. Handle Lions with respect and honor, even when they are displaying child-like tendencies, and you can find yourself in a winner of a relationship.\n"}
