{"content":"You are quite the dynamic duo. Even when you are on your own, you are usually ready to do something new and exciting. Now, with a Sagittarius, you make an action-oriented pair, for you love to be on the go almost as much as your Sagittarius does.\nYour impulsive temperament and quick-to-change ways may challenge the Sagittarius who prefers to set goals and strives to accomplish the tasks. Other planets in your chart, such as the Moon or Mars in an earth sign, may slow you down or make you less impulsive, thus increasing compatibility. Nevertheless, when you are with another fire sign, you stimulate each other toward new heights of accomplishment and achievement.\nThe optimistic character of Sagittarius is compatible with your cheerful disposition. With a Sagittarius, you adrenaline-seeking Aries will seldom find yourself caught in a rut of boring routines. Together you will blaze trails, light the fires of excitement and create adventures with one another.\n"}
