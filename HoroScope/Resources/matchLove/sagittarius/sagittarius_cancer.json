{"content":"Your restless nature and inquiring spirit may be somewhat unsettling for the more passive and home-centered Cancer. You just cannot stay in one place very long before you get this irrepressible need to expand your horizons and to go out exploring the terrain of unknown vistas. You need to push out the edges of the envelope as you live for adventure.\nMeanwhile, your Cancer lover requires a safe sanctuary where they feel securely protected from the tides of change. If your Crab is able to give you enough freedom so you can explore the outer reaches, you may find a nurturing friend and a tender lover within this relationship.\nBut, it is also possible that you will feel trapped by the emotional insecurities of your Cancer partner. It may be beyond your capabilities to give them what they need, for you are committed to truthful, honest and straight-forward behaviors, which may hurt Crab's overly sensitive feelings.\nIf the Moon or Mars in your chart is in a water sign, then you'll probably be more responsive to your Cancer lover's emotional needs.\nNo matter what, you'll need to find ways to comfort the worries and overcome the fears of your Cancer lover. Additionally, he or she must be willing to include your sense of global awareness within the home and in the family. This is not a natural pair, but together you can create a stable home from which you can journey outward, both in body and in spirit.\n"}
