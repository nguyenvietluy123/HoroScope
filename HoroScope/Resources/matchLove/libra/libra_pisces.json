{"content":"You love to learn about life and yourself through the perception of the people around you. This is one reason why you are a relationship-oriented person. There is, however, an aloof quality about your approach to people that can dominate your personality if you become too absorbed in indulging your self-awareness.\nWhen in a relationship with the compassionate and universally minded Pisces, you may find an avenue of selflessness that you've not previously explored. Pisces is not so interested in the evolution of the self as much as the continual evolution of the human race.\nOn the surface this sounds like you have something in common, but more often than not, you two will need other indicators in your charts to create compatibility. If the Moon or Venus in your chart is in a water sign, then the emotional underpinning of your Pisces lover won't seem so mysterious and difficult to understand.\n If the two of you are to prosper as a pair, you'll need to find an acceptable balance between working on achieving harmony in your own relationship and your humanistic concerns for the planet.\nYour innate grace and social skills, coupled with your lover's emotionally sensitive nature, can bring about a peaceful resolution to any dissonance you may meet along the path of your relationship.\n"}
