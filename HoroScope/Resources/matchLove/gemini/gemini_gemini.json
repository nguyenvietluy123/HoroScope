{"content":"For the most part, people who share the same sun sign have a tremendous amount in common. However, some of the duo sun sign combinations share their traits more harmoniously than others do. As an air Gemini whose restless mind is always moving, you tend to clash a bit more with a fellow Gemini than other zodiacal \"twin signs.\"\nYou are such a mercurial chatterbox that in an intimate relationship with another Twin, you may be so busy conjuring ideas and clever responses before the other has finished a sentence that you don't really listen to what your equally talkative partner is saying. Needless to say, this can cause problems and may create an agitated atmosphere within the relationship.\nIf you each have your Moon in a water or earth sign, there is a higher level of compatibility and an easy way beyond this problem. No matter what sign your Moon is in, if you learn to focus on your partner rather than just listening to yourself talk, you can dynamically raise each other to new heights of creative genius and exploration.\nRemember, this relationship is a mental one and the sexual attraction here is based on the mutual appreciation of the words you share. Together you can be all talk and no action unless you make a real effort to take care of the practical things in your life.\n"}
