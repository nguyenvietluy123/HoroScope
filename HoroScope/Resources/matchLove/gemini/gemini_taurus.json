{"content":"Your lighthearted and fast-moving mind finds solid ground to rest upon when you team up with a more practical and levelheaded Taurus. The problem is that you may quickly become bored, unless your Moon is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) or your Mercury is in Taurus.\nRegardless of other planetary locations, your fast reflexes and agile constitution is quite different from Taurus' slowly deliberate and determined manner. If you can get past your differences in style, the two of you can really enjoy the company of one another.\nYour mate puts you at rest and allows you to stop spinning your wheels, which lets you make better use of your creative potential. Your brilliant abilities flourish as you put your ideas into a solid format that can be shared with others and built upon. On the other hand, you are the sales person who can promote the Taurus' fine reputation and solid integrity. Although your flirtatious nature may irritate your lover, he or she will stand by you through thick and thin, as long as you don't overdo it.\n"}
