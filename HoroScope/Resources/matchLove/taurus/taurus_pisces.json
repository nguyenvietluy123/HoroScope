{"content":"Your simplistic earthy and practical character provides a supportive foundation for the dreamy Pisces.\nYour watery Pisces thrives in a private world of nonverbal symbols and active imagination. Pisces is sensitive, highly compassionate, and empathetic. Your down-to-earth sensibility mixes remarkably well with your fish's refined attitudes toward love and relationships.\nYour planet is Venus. Pisces is associated with Neptune. Venus and Neptune play well together, especially when engaged in places where the physical senses meet up with fantasy. Your pursuit of love, whether it is through art, music, or people, is of the utmost importance to Piscean partner. He or she knows how to pluck gently at your heart strings, making for a harmonic and loving union between these two sun signs. Your stubbornness, which can get in the way of love, melts and becomes rather tender under the Piscean influence.\nThis is a good match, but other planetary placements in each chart can add complex dimensions to this relationship. For example, if Mercury or Venus in your chart is in Aries, you may find it difficult to get along with your Pisces lover. On the other hand, if your Moon is in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), compatibility is improved.\nUltimately, you are like the proverbial Bull in a fish bowl. You'll need to give your Pisces mate enough encouragement and support so they don't feel too fragile around your solid determination.\n"}
