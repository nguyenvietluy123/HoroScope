{"content":"You are an independent person that does not like to be dominated or suppressed. You will clash with the authority and power of the establishment, often choosing to move beyond confines of traditional structures. On the other hand, you can create your own rigid structures as you are highly opinionated and can be intellectually snobbish at times. Needless to say, this inflexibility can bother those who share some of the same traits.\nWhen you hook up with a Scorpio, you meet someone who may be less overt in their desire to overthrow the establishment. They are, however, also keenly aware of power struggles and authority issues. They, too, have fixed ideas and notions about the world they live in, and prefer to engage with people with similar outlooks and beliefs politically and socially. This is the strength and weakness of this relationship.\nIf you can find a common ground that sustains both of your ideals and core beliefs, then this union is meant to thrive. If not, you may put most of your energy into disagreements and power struggles between the two of you. Personal life issues can be just as heated and conflicting as global ones, so it is best for you two highly intense and intelligent people to make sure you stand on shared territory before engaging in a long-term relationship.\nOn another front, you may find that your Scorpio lover is too emotional. His or her intensity can create the possibility of mind-bending sexual encounters, but you may not be willing to pay the price of admission. You feel more comfortable in an intellectually-driven relationship with less emphasis on irrational feelings. If, however, the Moon or Mars in your chart is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you'll be more eager to jump into the emotional depths.\nThe power of your love can prevail, even over these differences, but it may not be easy. If the two of you truly love each other, you will find a way to achieve a balance of power in the union.\n"}
