{"content":"You just love the complexity of words, ideas, and verbal communication. In fact, you can tap dance your way through clever conversations as if life was an ongoing cocktail party. Your Pisces lover, however, is dreamy, preferring a quiet world of spiritual thought, exotic imagination, and vivid fantasy.\nWhile you push forward into the world with a confident command of language and versatility, your partner gently leans into new experiences with uncertainty and sensitive compassion. You have to speak outwardly whereas Pisces requires time to reflect inwardly.\nAs each of you brings a unique personality into this relationship, you will both need to adapt a flexible approach to life. Flexibility is your middle name, but your partner may be difficult for you to read, so you won't know which way to turn. If you have strong contacts between the Moons in your individual charts, you will be more sensitive to each other's needs.\nYour fishy friend can teach you how to weave magic and words into ideas with a new awareness and sensitivity. Meanwhile, you encourage your Pisces to rise above the water and to peek out toward a wide and diverse world, helping him or her to discover new vistas of experience and fulfillment.\nA mutually satisfying relationship develops as you each adapt to the different approach each other carries into life.\n"}
