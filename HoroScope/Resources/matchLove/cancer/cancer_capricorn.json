{"content":"You are more sensitive to the needs of others and care more deeply about the emotional health of the community, family and friends than any other sign. Accordingly, it is more difficult for you to express your own needs. Sometimes you can feel as if others are not as attentive to your moods and feelings as you are to theirs. Capricorn is the exact opposite sun sign from Cancer and they are not known to show emotions and feelings easily. They are practical people who would rather not reveal their vulnerability to the world.\nThere will be plenty of opportunities for both of you to explore each other's traits. Your own emotional well-being will depend upon your ability to communicate your feelings with integrity. Your Capricorn lover must learn to pay attention to your mood swings in order to gain your trust and develop intimacy. Otherwise, you'll retreat by suppressing your feelings-and rather than expressing your pain, you'll grow resentful. Obviously this is not a formula for a successful relationship.\nYour compatibility depends upon your acceptance of your lover's practical and cautious nature. You may not be able to get the constant attention and feedback you crave, especially if your Moon or Mars is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces). If you can maintain emotional balance, you will learn much about the outer world from your Capricorn partner. Opposites attract for a reason and this relationship offers potential for growth and self-realization.\n"}
