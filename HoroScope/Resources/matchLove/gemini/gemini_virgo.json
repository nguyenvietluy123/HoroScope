{"content":"With Virgo, you may have found your mental match. This can be good news or bad news, for your thinking styles are very different from one another. Both of you are ruled by the planet Mercury, which governs the mental aspects of the personality, creating quite an analytical and heady relationship.\nWhereas you are openly expressive and as curious as any cat, your Virgo partner may see you as a bit scattered within your daily focus-or lack of it. If Mercury or Venus is in Taurus in your chart, however, you'll be more focused and compatibility will be much easier. No matter where your other planets are, Virgo can be impatient with you.\nMeanwhile, you will probably get annoyed by the nit-picky attitudes of your Virgo mate. His or her personality can be somewhat critical, focusing too much on minute details that you think are irrelevant.\nHarmonious activities that you can share involve reading and discussing books, writing projects, movies, puzzles, and talking about politics or intellectual topics. Your Virgo can be as smart as you are and you both appreciate the virtue of intelligence. Romantic interplay involves wit and candor.\n"}
