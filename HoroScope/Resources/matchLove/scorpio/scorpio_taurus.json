{"content":"You are passionate and sincere when it comes to relationships and sexuality. You need intensity and take pleasure in adorning your mate with affection and attention. If, however, you feel double-crossed, insulted or otherwise emotionally wounded, it may take a couple of lifetimes for you to forgive your lover.\nIn Taurus, you find someone who is trustworthy and has basic and simple needs. Your Taurus mate is secure, sensual and steadfast in relationships. Occupying the opposite zone of the zodiacal wheel, your Bull loves to be on the receiving end of your intense passions.\nThe two of you will indulge each other, spoiling one another and thoroughly enjoying the experience, as long as you maintain you status quo regarding relationship needs and wants. This is a delicate balance, for trouble can quickly brew if you two fixed signs have power struggles over dominance. You each make a worthy adversary if it comes to that, and an emotional meltdown between the two of you would not be a pretty picture.\nOther problems may arise if you feel too restrained by the down-to-earth simplicity of your Taurus partner, unless you have the Moon or Venus in a practical earth sign.\n The good news is that together, the two of you will have a strong flair for romantic evenings, candle-lit dinners, and gift giving. The trick will be how to maintain balance and if you can do this, it can be very satisfying and rewarding for both of you.\n"}
