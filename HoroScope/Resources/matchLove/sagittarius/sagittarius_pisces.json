{"content":"You Sagittarians are often interested in religious studies, philosophies and global issues. You are curious about the world you live in, and seek to create a path in life that balances your humanistic and individual goals.\nPisces folks are also spiritually inclined, but less interested in the ideas of the religion than in the actual practice, for they like to experience altered states brought on through spiritual practice. On the other hand, they may just be attracted to fantasy.\nEither way, this is a rich relationship that will expand and deepen your life. Your Pisces lover seeks union with those who are able to perceive the mystical and sacred origins of life, and are drawn to those with charitable compassion and a desire to be of service to the world.\nTherefore, the common ground between you and your Fish friend is your mutual awareness of the world and your desire and hope to aid those who need it. There are, however, important differences of style that will have to be acknowledged.\nYour fiery nature is intellectual and action-oriented. You seek adventure. Your water mate is less outgoing than you, and seeks emotional understanding. If you allow for your personality differences, you can strengthen each other while working, living and loving together, especially if you find a common cause.\nOn the romantic side, you will need to pay attention to the sensitive needs of your tender Pisces lover and open your door to a world of imagination that is richer than you ever imagined. If you have Venus in Scorpio or the Moon in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), compatibility is easier.\nYou partner will have to be willing to quicken the pace of their daily life, and join you on your quests for the great adventure.\n"}
