{"content":"Cancer-Virgo Compatibility \nCancerians are represented by crabs. And crabs are very sensitive and slow whereas Virgos are logical and patient. Both will match with each other despite their different characteristics. Cancerians have sharp features and firm posture that may attract Virgos but their mood swings will definitely create an awkward situation for Virgos. Cancerians love practical outlook and simplicity of Virgos and in turn, Virgos will also be drawn towards the affection and compassionate behaviour of Cancerians.\n \nCancer Man and Virgo Woman \nA Virgo woman will always try to make a Cancerian man happy and gay, cuddle him whenever he needs. And, a Cancer man with his imaginative power, sharp memory and attractiveness will allure a Virgo woman. Both, Cancer man and Virgo woman are compatible to each other because of their mutual understanding. The two zodiac signs will be strongly tied with love, affection and trust. They just need to control their extreme sensitiveness and critical nature. \n \nCancer Woman and Virgo Man \nThere is rarely a couple that long-lasts and live happily and the match of a Cancer woman and a Virgo man is one of them. A Cancer woman is very emotional and dependent and a Virgo man will always give her security and warmth that she needs. There may be chances of arguments between the two zodiac signs when a Virgo man is not able to express his feelings and a Cancer woman is not able to control her changing moods. However, both the zodiac signs will learn from each other and will try to avoid unfavourable situations.\n"}
