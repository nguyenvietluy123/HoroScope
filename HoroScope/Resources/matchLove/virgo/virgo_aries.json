{"content":"Your personality is detail-oriented, focused, analytical, and organized. You are a perfectionist who likes things to be done well and efficiently. You can be critical and judgmental in ways that become self-defeating if not kept under control.\nAries, on the other hand, lives a life that is somewhat looser around the edges. Your Ram mate is a pioneer that will push ahead with less organization and a minimal emphasis for detail. Needless to say, this trait can irritate the heck out of you and put you on edge. You'll find yourself judging your irrepressible Aries as juvenile or even simplistic, and in all fairness, this isn't necessarily an accurate picture. In spite of your great ability to focus on details, you can err on the other side of the coin, by not seeing the bigger picture in life's everyday dramas.\nIf the Moon in your chart is in a fire or air sign, you will be appreciative of your Aries lover's innovative and courageous zest for life. If your Moon is in an earth or water sign, it may add to your caution and your hesitance to endorse your Aries' sense of immediacy.\nThe bottom line is that Aries are movers and shakers and your life will not be dull if you partner with a Ram. Your sense of stability can help ground the Aries. You can make good business partners, for you provide the follow-through. If you can learn to accept your differences of lifestyle, you stand to learn much from the happy and inspired Aries who can, in turn, light up your life.\n"}
