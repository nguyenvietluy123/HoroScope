{"content":"You are not normally too judgmental, but your refined sense of beauty will either adore Leos or find them totally exasperating.\nIf you are in a relationship with a Lion, you probably fell on the side of adoration. This is perfect, for your Leo mate needs outward displays of love and affection.\nYour Lion can bring new friends and social experiences to you, for Leo is generally optimistic and outgoing. And you do enjoy the social events and opportunities to meet new and interesting people. You do, however, have particular tastes that can, at times, seem picky ... especially to your Leo partner, who is more concerned with good fun and cheer than discriminating against being in a wrong social circle. But as long as your partner receives a fair share of attention and recognition, things will remain at peace.\nOne problem is that you can feel disdain for showy exploitation, preferring the more astute and intellectual company of friends. This can be even more problematic if your Venus is in Virgo or Scorpio.\nYou'll have to open your thinking to allow your partner's friends to enter your life. You will be happier in this fun-loving relationship if you don't try to prune away your Leo's grandiose social life. Give your mate enough room to find amusement and he or she will open your heart in a way that you never imagined possible.\n"}
