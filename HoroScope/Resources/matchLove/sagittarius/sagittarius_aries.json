{"content":"You project optimism and are attracted to the big picture with your larger-than-life ambitions. Usually you are friendly, humorous and even inspirational at times. You can persuade others to act decisively as you are very good at devising a plan and creating a positive vision for the future. You seem to be lucky and can often meet the end result with success and good timing.\nAll this adds up to you being a great match for the pioneering Aries individual who, with good cheer and amicable intention, will sometimes lose interest in a project half way through. They benefit from your goal-orientation, for you can see a project through to the very end. But you get some goodies from your Aries lover, too, for he or she can motivate you to get going.\nTogether you two fire signs can pave a path of inspiration and creativity. You are both action oriented and will engage in all kinds of activities together, including travel, socializing and sports...anything that is a good time.\nAlthough you get along well with each other, you are both so independent that you may not be willing to commit to a long term relationship, unless you have the Moon or Mars in an earth sign or a water sign.\nAlthough you like adventure, your Aries lover may need higher levels of excitement than you'd like. Aries can annoy you with their in-your-face attitude when they want things their way. Even so, you find a playmate and a partner in your Aries mate and if you can keep your feet on the ground, you'll make a joyous couple.\n"}
