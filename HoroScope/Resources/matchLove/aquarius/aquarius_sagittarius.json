{"content":"You are innovative and original in your pursuits. You are attracted to others who share common concerns in the world as long as you think they are intelligent, compassionate and well intentioned. Yours is an intellectual attachment at first, and you can enjoy your friendship with a Sagittarius, remaining loyal and trustworthy through thick and thin. Since you are not emotionally charged, it is best for you to relate to others through rational thinking...and rationally, your Sagittarius lover scores enough points for you to pursue the relationship.\nSagittarius makes a fine companion for you. He or she is goal-oriented, dynamic in their global and international interests and shares a common desire to bring a broader perspective into the minds of the collective. Whereas you tend to be motivated by originality, your partner is motivated by high ideals. This is a good mix, for you can easily share your vision with good humor and intelligence with your friends and with the company of well-educated groups and individuals.\nYour Sagittarius lover may not be cuddly, but that's okay with you. You'll gladly allow your mate the room needed to follow his or her adventurous spirit, if in return he or she gives you the emotional distance you need to feel comfortable.\nIf the Moon or Mars in your chart is in Virgo or Pisces, compatibility may be more difficult, for you may have conflicting needs.\nUltimately, this is an exciting and active union that produces and inspires big ideas and innovative living. The two of you are highly compatible, and can go the distance with an emotionally satisfying union.\n"}
