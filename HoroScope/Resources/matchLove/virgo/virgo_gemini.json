{"content":"Both you and your Gemini acquaintance have the planet Mercury as your ruling planet. Mercury is associated with all forms of communication, language and writing, so words, ideas and conversations are lively and emphasized in this relationship.\nYou can establish resourceful and creative analysis within the framework of your partner's active imagination and thinking. Since you both love a well-crafted sentence, together you can revel in the beauty of speech and music. With all these similarities, you might think this is a match made in heaven, but your styles of communication are quite different. Your refined style is practical and highly critical, making you a talented editor type. Meanwhile, your Gemini mate is comfortable when talking without a script, making them more social and quite charming at a cocktail party.\nIf your Mars is in a fire sign or an air sign, you may also feel at ease jumping into a conversation that was started by your partner. But if your Mars is in a water sign or earth sign, you may have difficulty keeping up with their clever one-liners.\nWherever your Mars is, you might find it difficult to relax around your restless Gemini lover. You can burn off some of this energy by engaging in discussions about books, participating together in literary projects or exploring the outer reaches of new forms of communication, such as the Internet. Romantic involvement with the two of you rationalists is as much a mental pursuit as a physical one. The right words can inspire much passion.\n"}
