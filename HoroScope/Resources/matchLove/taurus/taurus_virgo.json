{"content":"You earthy Bulls function quite differently than Virgos -- another earth sign -- yet you remain quite compatible as you share a practical approach to life. Your Virgo lover is ruled by the mental planet Mercury, and is fixated on details, perfection, and edits life with a fine-tooth comb. Their analytical and sometimes critical style can put you into a tailspin. You are probably the more grounded and choose to make your basic decisions by simplification and determination rather than complex analysis.\nYour planet, Venus, is more focused on the practical realities of love, the physical pleasures it can offer, and plain old good-hearted fun. With a Virgo, you can unite intellect with emotion. You make a good team because you bridge head and the heart in a practical and tangible way by sharing similar interests and concerns. For instance, you could create a wonderful garden together through your partner's mental planning and design skills combined with your manual labor, artistic eye, and dedication.\nIf the Moon or Mars in your chart is in Gemini or Sagittarius, there can be stressful differences of life style, making compatibility more difficult.\nWhatever stresses other planetary placements may add, good teamwork and mutual respect makes this a feel-good combination that can stand up to the tests of time.\n"}
