{"content":"Libra-Pisces Compatibility \nThe Libra and Pisces if united in a relationship will have to bear lots of complications and confusions. In the end the relationship will result in a total mess. Fishes are very sensitive and befuddled creatures. On the other hand, Librans are very easy-going and pleasant personalities and the behaviour of a Piscean may lash him into sullenness. However, they both will be inclined towards creativity, warmth and passion. To sustain the relationship they need a lot of support from each other otherwise it may go haywire. \n \nLibra Man and Pisces Woman \nThere are negligible chances of lasting love between a Libra man and a Pisces woman. Initially, romance between a Libra man and a Pisces woman remains in its highest form. Both will be inclined to art and compassion. However, a Pisces woman, sometimes in their emotional overflow will ruin the Libra man's jovial mood. The match is not compatible as both of them have major differences which will make it a meaningless relationship. They both are so busy in their own worlds that it may not be possible for them to figure out the same world where they both can reside together happily.\n \nLibra Woman and Pisces Man \nA Libra woman has a different look out for problems or situations from that of a Pisces man. A Pisces man will try to solve the problem on emotional level whereas a Libra woman uses intellectual background to come out of the difficult situation. However, the deep romance and love for art and music will be shared by both the zodiac signs. Somehow, the clashes are unavoidable and hence the relationship is hopeless.\n"}
