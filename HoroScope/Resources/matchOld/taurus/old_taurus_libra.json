{"content":"Taurus-Libra Compatibility \nBoth Taurus and Libra are ruled by Venus, and hence the perceived similarity. But then, appearances are often deceptive, for both may be as different as chalk and cheese, especially when it comes to each Sign's approach to love. The practical Taurus may find the idealistic notion of love the Libra may harbour as frustrating or over-the-top! And soon, the initial flames of passion, which are bound to be there, may fade into a stubborn confusion. That said, it must be noted that this is not an essentially negative combination. But, what is given is that each would need to make a plenty of adjustments. On a practical level, Taurus likes everything to be airtight, while Libra loves assessing the pros and cons. Libra loves the works, the accessories and being praised to the skies, but earthy Taurus ensures that their (both the Bull's and Libra's) feet remain firmly on the ground. \n\nTaurus Man and Libra Woman \nTaurus man and Libra woman do not make a good match on the compatibility table. But that is least thing to worry as love for music, film and art are the common areas of interest for both of them. His possessive nature will not allow her to mingle with others which she likes to. Their compatibility rates average as they try to spend quality time with each other in spite of their dissimilarities. Ganesha foresees that the compatibility will work well between them if they try to keep their cool in adverse conditions. \n\nTaurus Woman and Libra Man \nThis compatibility is as beautiful as a rose for the relationship is highly romantic and the passion they share is intense.
