{"content":"Opposites sometimes do attract and you and your Gemini lover are opposite each other in the zodiac circle. Both of you emphasize communication, education and all types learning pursuits. You both prefer to be active, versatile, and spontaneous.\nYou, however, have a wider reach in your vision and loftier goals than your Gemini lover who stays closer to home, both mentally and physically. Your exalted vision and global perspective expands into cultures far and wide, and you probably have airline mileage to prove it. You partner's travel, however, is more inclined to be more like commuting on a day-to-day basis within the structure of their everyday life.\nGemini is interested in information in the immediate neighborhood and interactive encounters with people on an everyday basis, where you are attracted toward big-thinking philosophies and developing long-range plans. You may discover that your partner gets on your nerves because they always seem to be talking, even when they have nothing important to say.\nIf, however, you have Venus or Mars in an air sign, you'll be less judgmental of Gemini's tendency to waste energy in endless communication.\nUltimately, your fire mixes well with your partner's air. You each add a perspective that the other lacks. You make a great work or play team, but you can be a little scattered, so it is necessary for at least one of you to maintain a solid footing in your daily affairs. Playful and alive, you can certainly spark chemistry between you.\n"}
