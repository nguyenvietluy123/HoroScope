{"content":"Sometimes a relationship with someone of your own sign is a perfectly wonderful thing. You Librans, however, have an innate willingness to lose yourself into your partner and do what is needed to make a perfect relationship. Put two of you together, and you may flounder about, for without the presence of a grounding influence, this may be a pie-in-the-sky union without the means to bring it into full fruition.\nBoth of you are highly idealistic and artistic. Sure, you can build castles in the sky, but the question remains -- can you bring it to earth? When you are with another Libra, the placement of the other planets in each of your charts will determine whether you are mutually compatible. In particular, you'll need good aspects between the Moon, Venus and Mars. If these are present, this relationship can be just what the love doctor ordered for you.\nRegardless of these other planets, you can achieve great success with a Libra lover if you each practice sticking to commitments, following through, and making precise and clear decisions that benefit the two of you as well as others. Together, you can enjoy creating music, art and clothing and may enjoy sharing poetry. A romantic involvement could include writing love letters and sharing intimate thoughts.\nThis can be a very sweet and lovely union, but again, the question arises-can you two stay centered enough to produce the stability needed for the long haul?\n"}
