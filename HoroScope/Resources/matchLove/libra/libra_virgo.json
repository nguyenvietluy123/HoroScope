{"content":"You can have a difficult time making decisions because of your unique ability to see both sides of most situations. Accordingly, you make great mediators. But, unlike the other zodiac signs, you need a constant flow of input from others around you in order to know yourself or others fully.\nYou move back and forth like a see-saw, from idea to idea, until you are externally motivated or forced to make a final decision. This trait will be difficult for Virgos, who are exact and finite about details and life agendas. In fact, you can make them quite crazy. You do enjoy each other's refined individual presentation and probably feel at home when you are around each other. In a daily routine, however, you'll find yourself frustrated by your mate's impatience and criticism toward your changing mind.\nYou two make good classmates and can help each other along a course of common study. As romantic partners, however, you're going to need help from compatible placements of your Moon, Venus and Mars.\nEven with help from the romantic planets, you'll still need to make solid decisions and stick to agreed-upon commitments for this relationship to last.\n"}
