{"content":"You are very sensitive, compassionate and take good care of those you love. Quiet, dreamy and imaginative, you need reflective time to remain centered and balanced. Meanwhile, Leo is dramatic, outgoing and is most comfortable in groups where recognition and affirmation is available. It's not that your Leo lover always needs to be the center of attention. He or she can, however, become vulnerable if not acknowledged within a social context.\nThe two of you are quite different and it will take some significant adjustments for both of you to find a firm foundation on which to stand together. You are sensitive to the vulnerable aspects of the Leo personality, and may be able to salve the big and tender heart of your proud Lion. But your lover may demand more from you than you can tolerate, causing you to withdraw into fantasy realms.\nYou must be willing to outwardly attend to the needs of your Leo partner, but your dreamy demeanor may feel on edge and overwhelmed by his or her action-hero outlook on life. You'll probably be pulled into the limelight whether you want it or not. If you have Venus in Aries or the Moon in any fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), you'll be better equipped to handle all the social activity, which will increase your chances for compatibility.\nAdditionally, your Leo mate will need to learn to give you the quiet time that you require for you to restore your vitality on a regular basis. When Leos are balanced and aware, they tone down the demands they place on others and place value on building their self-confidence from within. When this happens, you and your Leo mate can build a more lasting and meaningful union.\n"}
