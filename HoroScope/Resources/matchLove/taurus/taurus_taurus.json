{"content":"You are stubborn, loyal, earthy, and patient. Oftentimes you are slow to change, preferring the solid foundation of familiarity. When meeting a fellow Bull for romance, there will be a practical approach to love and marriage. Both of you possess steadfast values and a well-defined picture of the world around you. Relationships are rarely tolerable for you if you feel out of sync with your partner's value system. Accordingly, as long as you and your Taurus partner have similar philosophies about love, family, and money, the prerequisites for a deep bond is present.\nThe two of you together can enjoy activities such as gardening, hiking, and, certainly, sitting on a blanket in the meadow enjoying a delicious picnic. Indeed, you are both willing to satiate your senses and therefore probably share a love of eating. You will have to remain vigilant about encouraging each other toward laziness, and especially watch each other's intake of breads, sweets, and snacks. You may find it difficult to start projects together, but once started, you'll see them through to completion.\nRemember, two Taurus people can be quite different, depending on the placement of the other planets in the birth charts. For example, if you have your Moon in any fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius) or air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), your differences can feel very stressful.\nOther considerations aside, you can be quite happy with another Taurus as you move relentlessly toward creating your life together.\n"}
