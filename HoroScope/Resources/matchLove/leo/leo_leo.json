{"content":"When the same sun signs join together in relationship, there exists the possibility for growth and self-reflection for each individual. You Leos need plenty of attention and affirmation from the world around you.\nWhen two of you Lions unite, there may be some posturing and roaring as you compete for attention. One of you will want to be the alpha cat, but you're going to need to share the leading role. If, within the relationship, you each can remain good-natured, laugh at your own quirks and compliment each other, then you stand a good chance for success.\nYou are a creative soul and feel that you are special. It's difficult to confine your life to stringent rules. Put two of you together and you'll quickly learn how to cope with one another's tendency toward arrogance and pride or the relationship will self-destruct. You'll both need to learn to keep your claws retracted when you fight, or someone will get hurt. If either or both of you have the Moon in a more receptive earth or water sign, then compatibility is less of a struggle.\nUnderneath your apparent self-confidence is a vulnerability that can get the best of you. In a relationship with another Leo, you must stay aware of how you each can help one another with this sensitive personality trait. This relationship can be fantastic if you can get past the ego and control issues. If you do, you'll have many good times with your Leo lover, including activities with children, theater, sports and social events of all types.\n"}
