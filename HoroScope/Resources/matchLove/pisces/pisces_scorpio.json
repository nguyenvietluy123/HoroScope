{"content":"You are intimately aware of the suffering and torment taking place on a planetary level, even if your immediate surroundings are safe and loving. You are compassionate, caring and empathetic toward all those less fortunate than you. As such, you Pisces folks are often involved in organizations, hospitals, and volunteer programs which seek to offer healing to the world.\nIn Scorpio, you find someone who can go to the very depths of the emotional well with you. Scorpios carry intense concern for the world and are often involved in work projects that delve into the hidden mysteries of life, for that is where they see potential for fixing the ills of the world. Your Scorpio lover may be honest, forthright, and reliable when functioning from their highest potential, but when facing their own emotional fears, Scorpios can be stone cold and secretive, hiding their feelings deep within where they can be controlled.\nBoth of you are water signs and therefore are able to address the deeper realms of human life. Your styles of engaging the world are compatible. Your Scorpio lover is highly responsive to your universally-minded concerns while you are understanding and receptive of his or her fiery passions. You may have difficulty with practical issues unless your Moon or Mars is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn).\nYour relationship with Scorpio is a romantic one and if you choose to share your life together, the odds are in your favor. For sure-proof success, you'll need to teach your lover how to forgive and forget by your good example, and in turn you'll learn how to live life to the fullest.\n"}
