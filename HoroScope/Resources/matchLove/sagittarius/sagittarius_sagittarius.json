{"content":"When you look into the mirror of relationship and hook up with another Archer, you are initially delighted to have found such a cheerful and good-humored soul. After all, both of you are high-minded, restless and adventurous. And, of course, you are fun to be with.\nSo, put two of you together and it sounds awesome. You scurry around biking, hiking, and running from place to place. You share long discussions about philosophical ideas, world religions and educational pursuits with each other. You make the best of friends.\nProblems can arise, however, when you try to settle into a mutually satisfying routine. Neither one of you is inclined to provide the stability and foundation that the relationship needs. You'll both be coming and going, sometimes together but often without the other in tow, since your interests will diverge and neither of you will want to give up your independence.\nBut if one or both of you have Venus in Capricorn or Scorpio or the Moon in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn), your chances for long-term compatibility are greatly improved.\nIf you can slow the two of you down long enough to make a commitment to live and love together, your home may still have the demeanor of a hotel room, your personal items tossed about, due to your busy schedules.\nMost importantly, when you are in a relationship with another Sagittarius, aside from the intimacy and love shared, you will have a strong friendship base that can hold your union together.\n"}
