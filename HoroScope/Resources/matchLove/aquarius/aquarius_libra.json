{"content":"You are highly intelligent and need the company of refined friends in stimulating and progressive environments. Accordingly, you are astutely aware of the people you choose to relate with-preferring unusual, bright, and eccentric folks as friends and lovers. You are not attracted to crude and thoughtless individuals, and keep a distance from situations that offend your highly tuned sensibilities.\nIn Libra, you meet someone who is tasteful, refined, creative, and dedicated to the pursuit of beauty. All this fits your ideal and it is a good place to start a relationship. Libra's key planet is Venus, and as such they are attracted to peace in human relationships and are committed to finding balance in all that they do. Your Libra lover is well-intentioned with a great need to relate with others-including you-with dignity and awareness.\nThe two of you can get along very well together as you both possess a unique sense of style, intelligence and creativity. One problem may arise from your blunt honesty. If you are asked for the truth, you will give it, whatever the consequences. Your radical approach to intellectual honesty can be offensive to your partner, who may wish you'd think about the impact of your position before stating it and then letting the chips fall as they may.\nIf Venus in your chart is in Capricorn, your utilitarian values may clash with your mate. If Venus in your chart is in Pisces, the two of you may struggle to find common ground in what you like.\nYou are both mentally motivated air signs and you can have a relationship that is simulated by the elegance of language, even when it comes to physical pleasures. In an intimate relationship, the two of you together can delight in the magical exploration of your sexuality as a means to reach higher realms of the soul.\n"}
