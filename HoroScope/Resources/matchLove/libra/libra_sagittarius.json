{"content":"You are motivated by beauty and pleasure. You can enjoy excursions and outdoor activities that enable you to appreciate nature. You have a keen eye for environmental programs, community gardens, and interactive nature hikes and walks.\nActually, you Librans make good city planners or designers who seek to bridge the harmony of the aesthetics of nature with urban life. All this bodes well for a relationship with visionary Sagittarius, who is eager to learn, travel, and trek fields for new opportunities.\nYour Sagittarius partner will surely bring the bigger picture into your life, whether it is from the need to be outdoors or the need to think about things in a philosophical and global manner. Together, you blend your high ideals of a visionary world, crafted with the finer touches of intelligence and grace.\nOne problem that may arise comes from your need for harmony, whereas your Sagittarius lover will forego the abstract pleasure of beauty for the next adventure. Unless your Moon or Mars is in a fire sign, you may not always be ready to plunge into the proposed journey just because he or she has picked a destination.\nOn a smaller scale, it is very possible that you can create little worlds of diverse possibilities right in your own backyard. With a bit of practical assertiveness on your part and an action plan between the two of you, a wide range of options is available for a progressive and harmonious life together.\n"}
