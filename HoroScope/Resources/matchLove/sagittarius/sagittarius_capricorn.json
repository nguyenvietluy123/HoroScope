{"content":"You are basically good-natured and enjoy humor, jokes, tricks and most comedy. In fact, most of you Sagittarius folks can get uncomfortable if life becomes too serious and mundane. You are happiest when you are active, physically or mentally, and you make your life an adventure in every way you can.\nWhen you meet up with Capricorns, you are confronted with how serious and responsible they are by nature. They are solid and reliable individuals who are practical and well grounded in their daily life. This can get old, as you may feel that your Capricorn partner is often raining on your parade, telling you that your plans to go to India for the summer or your photography expedition to Kenya is too impractical.\nThe thing is that he or she is probably right, but you don't want to hear it. You are usually willing to risk your security for the sake of adventure. You are more carefree, while your partner will feel better if all the bills are paid before embarking on a journey with you.\nOn the positive side, your Capricorn mate can help you with managing practical matters including your financial affairs. It may not always be as much fun as you'd prefer, but you'll probably have the resources to actually go on that trip you've always dreamed about.\nYou have a positive and inspirational influence on your hard-working Capricorn as you bring laughter and lightness into his or her life. Although Capricorns are serious about work, they also take love quite seriously.\nIf you have Venus in your chart in Capricorn or if your Moon is in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn), your chances for compatibility are improved, as is the likelihood of sexual chemistry.\nWhen the two of you decide you want to pursue this relationship, you really mean it. You'll make good companions and can each offer the other well-developed character traits to balance your lives.\n"}
