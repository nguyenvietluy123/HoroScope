{"content":"Cancer-Sagittarius Compatibility \nSagittarius are simple, straightforward and intelligent people. Cancerians are vulnerable and empathetic. Sagittarius are blunt and don't understand Cancerian's emotional feelings. They will provide a Cancerian with comfort and pleasure via their good sense of humour and friendliness but will be unable to understand a Cancerian's mood swings. A Sagittarian is also fond of wandering which is just opposite to a Cancerian's desire of staying back at home. These clashes can be minimized with mutual understanding. \n \nCancer Man and Sagittarius Woman \nThe love match of a Cancer man with a Sagittarius woman is unlikely but not impossible. By working on their differences, the pair may compliment each other.
