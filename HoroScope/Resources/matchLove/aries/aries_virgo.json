{"content":"Your spontaneous and childlike ways can be critically and harshly judged by the analytical Virgo. Virgo is drawn toward service and hard work, and makes a wonderful host or hostess. They are usually first to tidy up after a party, school function, or holiday gathering. You, on the other hand, may on occasion forget the golden rule of service, preferring the gaiety of social pleasure and the personal gratification of the moment.\nGood humor is a key that can unlock the potential success between such different styles -- your impulsiveness and Virgo's compulsiveness. Virgos can have tremendous wit and you Aries really know how to laugh at yourself. If your Moon is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn), your chances for long-term compatibility are increased, since your styles may not be as different as described.\nIf you can each manage to respect your natural differences and make adjustments to your lifestyle, you can create a long-lasting team with your Virgo partner. Your open and cheerful ways can keep your Virgo happy, while they bring a level of mental clarity into your life that can really help you along on your path.\n"}
