{"content":"You build your dreams on the solid foundations of integrity and hard work. With practical intentions and steady pursuit, you can do just about anything you put your mind to. Your key planet is Saturn, symbolizing discipline and responsibility. In fact, unless you have the Moon or Mars in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you may seem overly serious, unemotional or cold.\nOthers can count on you for just about everything. Your weak point, however, is in the expressive realm, since you may not be demonstrative with your inner feelings and affections. All this adds up to a bit of a problem when you meet up with a Libra, whose ruling planet is Venus.\nWe're talking love, harmony, artistic expression and relationship orientation. He or she may feel stifled or restricted with your quiet reserve. Libra's artistic nature and flowing grace typically seeks a companion who is fair and just, and who can serve as a mirror to them in life. To your Libra mate, a life without sensitive sharing and beauty is particularly flawed.\nThe two of you are philosophically different and may have a difficult time finding the course of action that will suit one another's character. If, however, you have Venus in Aquarius or the Moon in any air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), your compatibility is greatly increased.\nWith shared values and mutual interests, you can be a welcome anchor for your flighty Libra who is often tossed about in the winds of change. You can assist him or her in assembling a foundation of productivity and creative success, while your life is enriched by a new appreciation of the power of love and the enjoyment of art, music and romantic partnership.\n"}
