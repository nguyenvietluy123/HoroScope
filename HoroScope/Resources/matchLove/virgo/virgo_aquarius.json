{"content":"You have very strong work ethics and are a service-oriented type of person. You have a deep desire to help others and are happiest when you are busy, working efficiently at your tasks. Aquarius cares deeply about the greater community and is the humanitarian of the zodiac. Together, you can make waves and have impact working with organizations, taking on projects and doing most any kind of group activity that involves high standards and shared values. For your own separate reasons, you each like the idea of doing things that insure goodwill toward all.\nThat being said, there are some formidable differences. You are a practical, detail oriented worker, whereas your Aquarius lover likes abstract intellectual principles. If you can stay open, you stand to gain from the \"big picture\" that your Aquarius offers. If you aren't too critical, you can benefit from the many friends and acquaintances which your partner brings into your life.\nIf, however, you have Mars in a fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius) or air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), then you may actually be as outgoing as your eclectic Aquarius mate.\nUltimately, your Aquarius lover needs to relate with intelligent people, and you qualify on this account. Therefore, you are not only a suitable mate, but your clear thinking can be quite inspiring to your partner. If nothing else, the two of you make compatible work mates and friends. And, of course, your compatibility can go much further.\n"}
