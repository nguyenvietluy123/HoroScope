{"content":"You are attracted to all things beautiful, and although your Capricorn lover may choose practicality over beauty, there is still common ground between you.\nYour relationship with a Capricorn can produce an environmental blend of your loveliness and his or her austerity. Your partner will be challenged by your \"out-of-this-world\" dreamy style, for the goal-oriented Goat is relentless about the need to focus on the responsibilities of daily life.\nIt's not that you are lazy, but you're just not used to putting your nose to the grindstone like the disciplined Capricorn, and you may feel rather burdened by the harsh expectations of your partner. If, however, Venus is in Virgo or Scorpio in your chart, you might be more understanding of this practical way of living.\nYou need time to dream of the fantasy world that you will build in the future. Your Capricorn partner needs to stick to the fundamental nuts and bolts, and needs to take care of business in the present.\nIf the two of you choose to build your paradise on earth together, you'll need to buckle down to the daily routine of practical work while your mate opens his or her imagination to the importance of beauty in your lives.\n"}
