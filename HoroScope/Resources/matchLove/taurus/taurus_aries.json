{"content":"You Bulls are the most practical, dependable and reliable people in the zodiac and may question the quick responses and impulsive actions of your Aries partner. You will be more apt to apply the new and highly creative ideas of the Aries into practical actions. Aries might resist your steadfast ways as they don't like it when life becomes entrenched in routine and therefore too boring for them.\nYour excitable partner is not known for his or her ability to tolerate boredom or repetitive tasks, even if these very same things bring you security and comfort. You do not have much patience when it comes to tolerating your Aries mate's unfinished business or their halfhearted commitments. Of course, other planets in your birth chart can change this. For example, if you have Mercury or Venus in Aries, you'll better understand your spontaneous partner. With your Moon in any fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), you'll have increased chances for a successful union.\nThe true test in this relationship lies in your ability to remain open to the Ram's impractical enthusiasm without feeling responsible to bring him or her to their senses. Allow room for change and there will be plenty of desire and lust between you two that can last a very long time.\n"}
