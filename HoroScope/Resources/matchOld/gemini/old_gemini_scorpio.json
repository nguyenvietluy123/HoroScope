{"content":"Gemini-Scorpio Compatibility \nGeminians are brilliant and enthusiastic but cannot stand jealousy and vengeful behaviour. They love and enjoy to be seen in social settings and Scorpions on the other hand are secretive and seek privacy. Geminians are self-centred, careless and diplomatic; Scorpions are jealous, possessive, and dominant. Both are almost opposite in their deeds and actions. The match has to struggle a lot to keep the relationship on track. \n\nGemini Man and Scorpio Woman \nA Scorpio woman will be captivated by the brilliance and zeal of a Gemini man. He will be attracted by her passion and loyalty. If both the zodiac signs mix together the results can be fantastic. But due to their negative aspects as jealousy and over demanding behaviour ( of a Scorpio woman), impatience and inconsistency (of a Gemini man), they may create obstacles for themselves. Ganesha insists that if they try to figure-out the pit-falls and then the chances of their, remaining together may increase. \n\nGemini Woman and Scorpio Man \nThe match is not meant for either of them because a Scorpio man has lots of expectations from her which may not be possible for a Gemini woman to fulfil. There may be some infatuation for each other in the beginning but the relationship cannot be dragged far-off considering this only factor. A Gemini woman is reckless and carefree which is intolerable by a Scorpio man and he is very suspicious and jealous which a Gemini woman always dislikes.\n"}
