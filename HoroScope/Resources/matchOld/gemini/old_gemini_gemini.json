{"content":"Gemini-Gemini Compatibility \nGemini individuals always display dual personalities. In one moment they will be happy, somber in the second and extremely nervous in the very next moment. Mercury instills adaptability, versatility inconsistency and impatience. Geminians are garrulous. They are clever individuals always in search of mental stimulation. They cannot remain interested in a single topic for too long and have a phobia of commitment. This sign clicks well with Leo, Libra, Aquarius and Aries. \n \nGemini Man and Gemini Woman \nThe result of this love match is endless fun and energy. Both the individuals are witty, talkative and adventurous. They like variety and sticking to a single thing makes them bored. Two Gemini individuals wrapped in a relationship can keep each other amused for a long time. But this is not all. They may find it tough to stick to anything for too long. The tendency of a Geminian to think from the mind, rather than the heart, may also create compatibility problems in this love match.\n"}
