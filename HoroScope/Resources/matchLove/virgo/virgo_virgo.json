{"content":"When others are in the company of two Virgos, they may feel as though they are witnessing an elite club meeting in progress.\nYou Virgos can find delight in each another for many reasons. You both see yourselves as slightly superior to the rest of the human race due to your innate organizational skills, acute detail in work, and your ability to execute ideas and put them into productivity. You are amazing, no doubt! No detail is too small to tackle or explain. The target problem areas of the relationship develop when your fastidious minds compete as to which one of the two will rule the roost. You both have set and exacting ideas, but they may differ widely, especially if Mercury in your individual charts is in different signs.\nIf, however, they are in the same sign, your ideas may be more complimentary, balanced, and cooperative. This mutual and shared intellectual perspective will allow for peace and happiness. There is good wit and humor shared between you two, but is usually on the dry side.\nThis relationship may function well and have an efficient practicality, but it's probably not going to be very warm and fuzzy.\n"}
