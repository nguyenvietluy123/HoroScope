{"content":"You can be quite traditional and sentimental regarding your personal memories and past. Whether your own past was traumatic or joyous, you will still have a keen awareness of your roots and family origin. Your challenge may involve a need to find balance as you let go of your own personal history so you can live more in the reality of your present-day life.\nAquarius, by contrast, easily lets go of feelings from the past and moves steadily toward a path of individuality and eccentricity. Your Aquarius lover is attached to the future while you are attached to the past-unless the Moon or Mars in your chart is in a fire sign. Your partner has broad and expansive ideals, and is often more aware of global and community needs than personal ones.\nObviously, you both need to make significant adjustments to accommodate your very different approaches to life. If you can trust enough to offer your partner independence, then you can both be happy in this relationship. Your Aquarius lover, however, must adjust to your emotional needs, so you can provide nurturing and support. In turn, he or she can assist you in the process of letting go of your past, freeing you to enjoy the freedom of new experiences.\n"}
