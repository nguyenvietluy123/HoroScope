{"content":"Cancer-Gemini Compatibility \nThis love match does not have much in common. They have their own approach towards solving problems. A Cancerian believes in action while a Geminian believes in mere words. On the positive side the wit, humour and intellect of the Gemini will appeal to the Crab and will make this match a love match. The Cancerian in turn will provide the stability and depth. Sometimes the flirtatious nature of Gemini may make Cancer feel jealous and insecure.\n\nCancer Man and Gemini Woman \nCancer boys are clingy. His suspicious nature may make him accuse her of being interested in other men and thus may harm the compatibility. Her explanations may not convince him thus making her tired of the Cancer guy. Initial attraction may arise from Cancer boy's passionate nature. He is born for commitments and there is no place for long lasting bonds in her dictionary. She needs to control her flirtatious nature and give her love and support which a Cancerian yearns for. \n \nCancer Woman and Gemini Man \nA Cancerian woman will be lured by the enthusiasm and energy of a Gemini man. On the other hand her charisma and sensitive manners will charm a Gemini man. But as the relationship develops more and more differences will start cropping up. His rationality may not gel well with her emotional nature and his aversion from commitment may make her feel insecure. Ganesha feels that it's important to be a source of comfort for each other, rather than a part of the problem.\n"}
