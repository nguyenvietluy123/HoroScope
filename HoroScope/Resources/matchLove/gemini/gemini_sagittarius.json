{"content":"You like movement in your life, in your mind and in your relationships. Your natural curiosity cannot be squelched. With a Sagittarius, you meet someone who is also interested in activity, but the Archer's arrow tends to aim far, so they tend to be attracted to a long journey rather than lots of little trips.\nYou are most compatible with your Sagittarius within the context of travel, adventure, and exploration. He or she will share your restlessness, and together you are on the move. If Mars in your individual charts are not compatible, you may have difficulty finding common ground for your adventures.\nWith Sagittarius, you find it easy to be open-minded, and the Archer's global awareness is exciting to you. Together you could plan a climbing expedition, an around-the-world tour, or a biking trip across Europe. In the context of everyday routines, you will be busy conjuring up your next play date or weekend getaway, knowing that your partner will be ready to go. The two of you can keep each other occupied with intelligent conversation and good humor.\nThis relationship is good for you as your Sagittarian lover tends to bring out the optimistic side of your life. Together, you can create a cheerful and bright home life. You two are quite compatible and can have a lasting and satisfying relationship for many years, although it may not ever feel fully stable.\n"}
