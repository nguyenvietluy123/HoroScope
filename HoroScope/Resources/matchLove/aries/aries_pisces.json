{"content":"As the first sign of the zodiac, you Aries are very different than Pisces, which is the last sign. You are robust, aggressive, and outgoing. You initiate action. Meanwhile, Pisces is sensitive, intuitive, and introverted.\nYou will, however, probably love the imaginative impulse of your Pisces partner, and they will enjoy your ability to enhance their dreams by taking actions to make them real. The problem is that your raw and natural instincts, when unchecked, can sometimes overwhelm the refined personality of Pisces. It's a good thing for you that your fishy friend can be compassionate and understanding.\nAs long as your actions are pure and well-intended, Pisces will try to find a way to remain flexible, supportive and receptive to your sheer enthusiasm. Sometimes, depending on other planetary placements in your birth chart, you Aries may have Piscean influences that can diffuse your differences. For example, with Mercury or Venus in Pisces, you'll have a natural understanding of your lover that will make communication easier between you. With the Moon in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) chances for compatibility are increased.\nThis is not an easy relationship, but can enrich your life and deepen your feelings if you can get past your differences in style.\n"}
