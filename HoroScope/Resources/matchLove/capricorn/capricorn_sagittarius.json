{"content":"You are business oriented and know how to make the most out of any situation. You can read into the spoken word with an uncanny knowledge of what makes people tick. You may have an inner philosophy and spirituality that can be overlooked by others. You are wise and enduring in work and can be a rare friend once trust has been established.\nAlthough you are quite different on many accounts, you can get along well with Sagittarius, primarily because you share an innate philosophy about life that governs you both from the inside. The ruling planet of Sagittarius is Jupiter, symbolizing a prophet or sage type of person who shares ideas and visions with an open and objective style.\nCapricorn is ruled by Saturn, which is more conservative, astute and father-time like-wise, discriminating, and authoritative. You are serious and tend toward realism, even pessimism at times. The archer is enthusiastic and inspirational, tending toward optimism, even denial of difficulty at times.\nYou'll find your Sagittarius mate to be annoyingly restless and \"always on the go\" as they seek adventure. He or she may find you restrictive as you hold back your excitement or approval.\nIf, however, you have the Moon or Mars in a fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), chances for compatibility is increased and you will be more inclined to go along with their active plans.\nIn friendship and love, your Sagittarius partner can brighten up your days and nights while you lend solid ground from which the two of you may thrive.\n"}
