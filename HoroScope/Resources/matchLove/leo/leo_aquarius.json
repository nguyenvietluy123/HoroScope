{"content":"Leo and Aquarius are two of the four fixed signs of the zodiac-representing a rigid, stubborn and sometimes unyielding nature.\nYou can be demanding and forceful if you don't get your own way. When things aren't to your liking, you can demonstrate a child-like mentality as you defend yourself against imagined threats, no matter what the odds. It isn't that you need to be right as much as you need to be recognized and loved. You just want your Aquarian partner to appreciate you. The problem is that Aquarius is opposite Leo in the zodiac, and your intellectually oriented Aquarius mate takes tremendous pride in rational logic. He or she is much more interested in being right. Recognition is secondary.\nSo, the two of you can go head to head demanding, pleading, and lecturing each other. This may sound terrible, but it can easily be avoided if you agree to remember two simple rules. The first is that you are ruled by the heart and need affection. The second is your lover is ruled by the head and needs mental interaction. If, however, the Moon in your chart is in an air sign, compatibility will be more easily within reach.\nOpposites really do attract and, in this case, you and your mate are intrigued by each other and will be drawn into exploring the potential of a relationship. Your compatibility is not insured, but you certainly can make it work if you are both persevering and flexible.\n"}
