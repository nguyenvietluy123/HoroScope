{"content":"You are sympathetic, adaptable and visionary. By nature, you are quite sensitive and very aware of the subtle currents of energy surrounding you. You have artistic and musical abilities, and are empathetic and intuitive. Aries people are individualistic and pioneering with a tremendous amount of courage and stamina. They use their will to accomplish tasks and goals with personal skill and enthusiasm. They can be impatient and may tend toward angry outbursts.\nThe two of you can be quite different. In some ways, when you hook up with a fiery Aries, it will be like oil and water. You can, however, lend a calm and sympathetic perspective to your Aries lover, softening his or her sometimes harsh and self-centered ways. And there are benefits here for you, too. The intense and focused drive of your mate can spur you into action in ways you've never imagined. This can be helpful and energizing to your normally mellow way of engaging the outer world. You tend to retreat into the backwaters of your imagination and into spiritual solutions. Your outgoing Aries partner will push you over the edge of your cliffs of hesitation and uncertainty. Problems arise, however, when you feel pushed too much or too hard by the unyielding and insensitive will of your Aries partner. On the other hand, he or she can get impatient with your unrealistic ways.\nYou seek to understand life from a sympathetic perspective and are willing to surrender to the needs of others when necessary. If you have Mercury or Venus in Aries, or the Moon in any fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), you will naturally understand and accept the sometimes abrasive actions of your Aries, thereby increasing chances for compatibility. It is vitally important that your headstrong Aries not bully you into following his or her agenda. Ultimately, your Aries lover will have to recognize and accept your tenderness and take your natural rhythms and flows into account when making plans for your future together.\n"}
