{"content":"You are dreamy, romantic, imaginative, and even musical or poetic. Sometimes, it is difficult for you to find other people who understand the breadth of your compassion and your vulnerable sensitivity. It is not always easy for you Fish to live in the material world because you are so naturally attuned to higher frequencies, to the invisible ripples in the seas of life. This is one reason why some Pisces individuals may lean toward escapist addictions such as drugs, alcohol or movies. But you can also choose to escape the mundane world by indulging in spiritual or creative pursuits.\nWhen you hook up with another Fish, you'll need to focus on building a foundation that is stable and centered. At first, you may feel extraordinary, as though you are looking into the magical eyes of your soul-mate. In time, however, you may find that staring into the eyes of your beloved can only last so long, for there are mouths to feed, jobs to do and the bills needing to be paid. In other words, your biggest challenge will be to find ways to ground yourselves together in the very world that you choose to escape from.\nIf the Moon or Mars in your chart is in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) it may be easier for you to deal with these very real world responsibilities. With or without other planetary placements in earth signs, you will need to find a stable rhythm and create regular routines that brings your life into the world, thereby enabling you to manifest your hopes and dreams.\nTogether, you may share poetry, music, dance, and sensual lovemaking. You will probably enjoy the pleasant company of other artistic and gentle people. It is also probable that you will have animals that you love as much as your own children. This is a tender and beautiful match as long as they can make the mechanical parts work in the real world.\n"}
