{"content":"Both you and your Scorpio lover have strong personalities and are quite fixed in your individual ways. There will need to be enough attraction between the two of you to overcome the initial resistance you each may feel toward the other.\nScorpios often find frolicking Leo a bit childish and difficult to understand, as they prefer their drama in private. They cherish boundaries and require more space in emotional situations than you do. You need dramatic and overt displays of love that you may not get from your Scorpio, who is more reserved and resourceful, careful of who they share their deep feelings with.\nIf your Moon is in Scorpio or Taurus, then you are already in touch with this conflict between what is expressed and what is held in reserve, thereby taking the pressure off your Scorpio lover.\nThe bottom line is that in order for this relationship to be successful, you need to learn how to be more introspective, while your lover makes a commitment to try to understand your need for attention. Given some common ground and support from a compatible Venus and Mars, you two can ignite a very intense and long-lasting passion that can fill your heart with joy and that can remain sexy throughout the long haul.\n"}
