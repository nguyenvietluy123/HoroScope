{"content":"You are quiet and love to indulge in the mystical, meditative and surreal aspects of life. You have an innate ability to be telepathic, soaking in the emotions of those around you. You are highly sensitive and can feel the pulse of other people's thoughts and energies. Your communication can be subtle, sometimes through music, poetry or dance. This enables you to cross the threshold of the material world into the sublime bounty of the unknown regions of spirituality, religion and art.\nWhen you hook up with a restless and verbally active Gemini, your cage feels rattled. Geminis are mental by nature and are inspired by language, storytelling and all forms of creative communication. They are the word wizards of the zodiac and possess great language skills.\nThe two of you have much in common, yet you tend to work with the energy in very different ways. You both move about frequently and may actually have many residences, relationships or jobs in your lifetime. You'll respect each other's need for stimulation, although you may feel that your Gemini lover is too noisy for your taste. If Gemini can incorporate your quieter inner mystical needs with his or her clever and witty communication style, you two can be quite entertaining together-and entertained by each other. Your Gemini may be a bit over-talkative while you may feel lost in another world, frustrating the verbal needs of your lover.\nYour chances for long-term happiness and compatibility are increased if you have the Moon or Mars in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), giving you more common ground on which to build your relationship.\nIn an intimately romantic relationship, you two will be best off if you read, write, meditate and share your visions with each another.\n"}
