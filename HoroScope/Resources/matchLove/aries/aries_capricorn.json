{"content":"Quick and eager for excitement, you hit solid ground, or maybe even a wall, with the practical purposefulness of a Saturnine Capricorn. You Rams butt heads with Capricorn the Goat, unless you can find a way to respect and honor each other's personal goals and drives.\nYou may be great at starting things but you're less accomplished at seeing them through to completion. Of course, the specific placement of the planets at your birth may alter this. For example, with Venus in Taurus, you may be more attracted to the practical side of your Capricorn lover. With the Moon or Mars in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) or water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) chances for long-term compatibility are increased.\nRegardless of these other planetary placements, when you are with a result-oriented Capricorn, you're going to have to learn to complete the tasks you start in order to win your partner's trust. On the other hand, your Capricorn mate needs to learn how to be comfortable uprooting and moving with your occasional impulsive needs for change. You're going to have to get used to your partner taking on more responsibilities than you would. You can help cheer them up with your enthusiastic encouragement when they are overwhelmed.\n"}
