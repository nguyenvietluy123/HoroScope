{"content":"You want a secluded home environment that reflects your need for depth and privacy, a place where you can safely express your passions with your lover.\nYour Aquarius partner needs a more communal or group-related life, preferring more casual interactions with additional people. This difference in approach to life can stop this relationship right in its tracks before it ever leaves the station. If, however, your can meet in the middle, you may together create a most interesting life -- one that is filled with eccentric and individual taste.\nTogether, you will prefer to host people in your home rather than venturing out into other people's territory. In this way, you get to experience the safety and integrity of your social world as you define it and your Aquarius mate is able to bring his or her need for additional interactions to the hearth of a comforting home.\nYou are both fixed signs and can be stubborn to the core. You'll need to stay vigilant on this issue or you can easily slip into engaging in power struggles. It will help if Venus in your chart is in Libra or Sagittarius.\nYour possessive tendencies may feel restrictive to your independent Aquarius lover. Trust is the key issue in this relationship.\nThis is not an easy combination, but you can achieve happiness and success if you can offer each other room to be who you are without judgment. It will take practice for each of you to set aside your strong opinions, but it can be worth it.\n"}
