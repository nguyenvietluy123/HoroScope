{"content":"Your efficient and responsible character gives others the message that you can carry the weight of the world on your shoulders, never needing assistance. Indeed, you may be a mighty goat, however, all too often you come to resent the role of authority you've agreed to play in the lives of those you love. Down the road, you may feel martyred, aware of how much you do for others with so little appreciation. This is a trap and you need to avoid this scenario like the plague. You are better off when you learn to surrender and to flow with the rhythms of the people around you.\nNow, into your life comes a soft, sensitive and compassionate Pisces partner, who melts your hard edges and invites you into their inner labyrinth of magic and enchantment. Do you have the courage to leave the real world behind? Is the spiritual and creative world of your Pisces love any less real than yours?\nYou can be absolutely captivated by the sheer elegance and magnetism of the Pisces fish, who brings the power of love into the hearts of humanity-into your heart-with gentle care and compassion. This relationship has great potential, especially if you can each get past your own self-limiting judgments.\nCompatibility is good to start, but even gets better if Venus in your chart is in Scorpio or Pisces, or if the Moon is in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces).\nYour Pisces lover will need learn how to appreciate your order and focus, which will be easier if you do not harshly judge him or her for their lack of practicality. If you can harmonize your authoritative personality with the dreamy and imaginative character of your Pisces mate, you can enjoy a lifetime of love and romance.\n"}
