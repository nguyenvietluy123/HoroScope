{"content":"You love to socialize and move about the world with candor and good cheer. At a party, you'll be one of the people who appears confident and is having a good time. You appreciate refined tastes and open-minded attitudes.\nLibra makes an aesthetic pleasing companion for you, as both of you are attracted to art, theater, music and uplifting surroundings. You attract a wide variety of friendships, and prefer to keep the company of those with similar values and tastes.\nYour Libra partner has a natural talent to put you at ease, for he or she is gracious and tends to your needs and the needs of the relationship in a loving and caring manner. Your occasional blunt mannerism can ruffle the feathers of Libra's fine social protocol. On the other hand, you just may not understand why they put so much stock into the rules of proper social etiquette.\nYou are a \"hands-on\" person, while your mate can be satisfied talking about it rather than doing it. You may not understand this part of their personality, unless you have Venus or Mars in an air sign, which can increase your acceptance of this difference.\nUltimately, the two of you are compatible enough that you can overcome whatever obstacles come between you. If you choose to live together, your home will be filled with a wide array of books, art, and travel maps, giving the two of you an artistic and worldly appearance to your friends and associates.\n"}
