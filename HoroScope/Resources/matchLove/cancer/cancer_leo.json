{"content":"You are emotional, sensitive and caring, and are very attracted to the radiant glow of the outgoing sunny Leo, even though the two of you are like night and day. The bright light of your Leo serves as a beacon of joy and love to you, who, in contrast, can feel shy, withdrawn and much less outgoing than Leo. Don't be misled, however, by the outer exterior of your Lion's roar and powerful charisma, for deep inside, he or she is a tender pussycat who just wants to be scratched and petted by you. Leos, too, are quite vulnerable and cautious in love, even if that's not what appears on the surface.\nYou have a way of understanding the needs of others in an extraordinary way, and thus, your Leo is allowed to go about his or her activities with a solid sense of security and love. If, however, you have your Moon or Mars in Scorpio, issues of jealousy may throw a monkey wrench into the works. Your Lion needs to feel adored and you know how to make someone be the center of your attention.\nYour deep emotional waters do not put out the flame of fire sign Leo. Instead, you are a sweet mist and a refreshing coolant to the passionate ways of the intense Leo. This can be highly compatible duo and given the opportunity, child-rearing together could be quite delightful. A lifelong union is possible if your Lion remembers not to hurt you with his or her roar.\n"}
