{"content":"Cancer-Aquarius Compatibility \nThe traits of Aquarians include performing experiments and love for freedom. The sensitive Cancerian will not be able to hold on to the stubborn Aquarius. Cancerians look for security and warmth from an Aquarius but their secretive nature will make them uncomfortable. In their pursuit to explore new ideas they detach themselves from the family. On the flip side, Cancerians have a very strong emotional bond towards their family. To sum it all, the match may not reflect a good compatibility. \n \nCancer Man and Aquarius Woman \nThis match cannot be called as the most appropriate as Cancer men are too emotional to compliment realistic and indecisive Aquarius women. Though, an Aquarius woman is kind and amiable still she may get annoyed by the hesitant Cancer man. A very contradictory trait of an Aquarius woman is that she loves living in isolation and still she has lots of friends but not close ones. An Aquarius woman seeks for the mate who is jovial and not clingy like a Cancer man. \n \nCancer Woman and Aquarius Man \nThe relationship may not enjoy the high spirits of life as the Aquarius man is entirely different from a Cancer woman in his traits. There is a constant urge for security and love on the part of a Cancer woman. On the other hand, an Aquarius man in his thirst for freedom makes the relationship painful and troublesome. Their relationship can only be nurtured if the emotions of a Cancer woman get married to the intellectual thinking of an Aquarius man.\n"}
