{"content":"You are attracted to movement and change. You love parties, meetings, and social engagements-anything where you get to share ideas and exchange words with like-minded people.\nYour Cancer lover, on the other hand, is not so driven by a need to interact with others. In fact, he or she is more attracted to security and home-centered activities, finding satisfaction from nurturing family and loved ones rather than interacting with outsiders. Your hard-shelled partner is a tenacious Crab and won't easily let go of the past.\nYou, on the other hand, are ready for whatever the present may bring. It boils down to the fact that your Cancer lover is an emotional water sign and you live in the airy mental realms, making for different priorities in your everyday lives.\nHowever, if your Venus is in Taurus or Cancer, you'll easily appreciate your partner's stay-at-home attitude. Wherever your other planets are, it is essential for you to learn the value of emotional expression, even if it makes you uncomfortable. You prefer to think about your emotions rather than feeling them. If you can slow down and let the feelings catch up with your thoughts, your sensitive Cancer friend will add meaning and richness to your life.\nUltimately, the two of you find compatibility only if you can find a balance between your feelings and your thoughts.\n"}
