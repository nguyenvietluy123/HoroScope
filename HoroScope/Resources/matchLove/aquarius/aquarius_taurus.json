{"content":"You are independent and your eclectic social views attract you to unique kinds of family arrangements. You seek to align yourself with individuals who share your passionate social values and sometimes even radical ideals. You are much more interested in sustaining intellectual friendship than romantic love, although you can be extremely devoted and loving once they have commited. Even as a parent, you tend to be friendly, aloof, and seek to encourage your children to find their own lot in life. This is so different than Taurus, who is fiercely simplistic, parentally protective and connected to basic values of home, security and finances.\n Once your Taurus lover has let you into his or her heart and home, it is very nearly impossible to let you go. Therefore, you may have to put up with your partner's ex-partners, children and extended family for a lifetime. This loyalty and care are at the core of the Taurus's foundation. Oddly enough, although you pride yourself in being open, you can resist change as much as your stubborn Taurus partner, who may find your independent ways threatening to the security of the home and family. But once you think it through, you can change in a millisecond, like a flash of lightning, whereas your Taurus Bull plods slowly through changes fighting and resisting along the way. You may find your mate's stubbornness and tenacity a bit smothering. If you have the Moon in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) or water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), your chances of a happy relationship are dramatically improved.\nOnce the two of your find the right niche for your friendship and love, you can endure a long life of progressive growth and deep love together.\n"}
