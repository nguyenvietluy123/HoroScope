{"content":"You Libras are gracious and easily project your individuality through cooperation with other people. Your personality tends to attract people into your life who can become a mirror to you, helping you gain elusive self-awareness. You carry a strong sense of justice in all your actions as you uphold the equality in all your relationships.\nAries is your astrological opposite. Aries are less prone to join groups and have less need for harmony in relationships. They are rugged individuals who prefer to work alone, as they can get impatient when they have to work with others. Therefore, you'll have to adjust to the extreme differences in character between you and your Aries lover. If, however, the Moon or Mars is in a fire sign in your chart, the differences won't seem so vast and your chances for compatibility are greatly improved.\nIf this union does occur, you will have to give your Aries partner a lot of latitude and room enough for independent action. Together, you'll need to find a middle ground that balances the Aries self-interests with your need for mutual sharing.\nThis relationship can work, but don't expect it to be easy. It will be like riding a see-saw as you go back and forth between the two poles of your individual styles.\n"}
