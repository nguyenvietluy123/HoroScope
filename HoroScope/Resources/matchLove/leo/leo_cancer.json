{"content":"You tend to direct your energy outward and may be considered extroverted. You are less inclined to consider the needs of others as much as your Cancer friend. Your bright and sunny ways may have to be adjusted to consider the emotions of moody Cancer. The Crab is often introverted, pensive and attuned to the feelings and sensitivities of others.\nIn a way, you are like day and night. You are the Sun. Your lover is the Moon. It will take some time for you two to adjust to this significant difference, but it will be easier if the Moon in your birth chart is in Cancer or another water sign, like Scorpio or Pisces.\nRegardless, you demand attention and need to be affirmed with approval in your daily life. You can easily outshine your partner, who may be quite good at meeting the needs of another, yet requires less attention and demonstrative affection. The most important thing, however, for your quiet Cancer sweetheart, is that he or she needs to be safe and secure in an intimate relationship. You must ask yourself if you have the ability to give this kind of healing devotion to your needy Cancer mate.\nHe or she may not prance in the spotlight with you, but the Crab's power is in their emotions and not their actions. You will need to offer each other plenty of room to express your natural differences, while at the same time paying close attention to the inner and outer needs of each other. This can be a difficult relationship unless, for the sake of peace at home, you are willing to turn your loud roar into a quiet purr.\n"}
