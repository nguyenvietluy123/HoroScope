{"content":"You are drawn to intelligent individuals who are superior communicators. You may not tolerate mediocre thinkers, preferring to relate with those who express progressive ideas with intellectual finesse. When you meet quick-witted and mentally agile Gemini, you can be swept off your intellectual feet, for the way to your heart is through language and ideas. You'll get along famously with your restlessly chatty Gemini friend, for both of you can plunge into the endless pools of cultural, personal and interpersonal communication, scanning the air waves for more and more intellectual fun.\n Together you can become information junkies, altering your life to support your passionate fascination with words. You'll look for ways to express your love for one another through eclectic ideas and carefully communicated perceptions. You make a life together that defies normal classifications. The biggest potential problem for this relationship is the lack of grounded practicality and your mutual eagerness to move away from emotions and toward rational logic. If either of you has the Moon in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces) or earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) you'll have a better chance to stabilize your compatible relationship for the long haul. If not, this may be a wonderful relationship that doesn't last very long.\nYou are both curious, needing room to roam as you explore the vast territories of the mind. You are friendly as a couple, and your home-probably filled with computers and books-will reflect your diverse interests as the two of you carve out a life that attracts a variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds and cultures.\n"}
