{"content":"Your character tends to be service-oriented with a keen awareness of your duties and responsibilities. You are exact in the way you deal with the mundane tasks of everyday life and are a great asset at work and at home.\nThe Sagittarius nature is dynamically different than yours, for they tend to be more broad-minded with sweeping goals and ambitions. Your Sagittarius partner is humorous, enthusiastic and good-natured. He or she tries to make the best out of every situation. Under pressure, you focus on the little things as the Archer aims the arrow of consciousness into the grand outer world. Your tendency may be to pull in to protect yourself in response to your mate's plans to travel or conquer the world. But if you can get past basic differences, the two of you can work effectively as a team, organizing the details of life with an open-minded awareness.\nYour chances for long-term compatibility are improved if the Moon in your chart is in a fire sign or air sign.\nIf you can harmonize your wonderful potentials, the two of you should be able to enjoy the pursuit of shared social and intellectual activities with great interest and success.\n"}
