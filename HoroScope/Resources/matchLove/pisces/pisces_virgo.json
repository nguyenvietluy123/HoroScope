{"content":"Virgo is opposite you on the zodiac wheel, and in many ways is a mirror image for you. Even though some of your characteristics are polar opposite, you do seem to mutually attract each another. You are dreamy and imaginative, love fantasy and operate from a non-rational emotional perspective. On the opposite side, your Virgo partner is detail oriented, well organized, efficient and rational.\nWith so much difference, it would seem as if you would never get along with Virgos, but it is quite common to find this pair in a very successful relationship. Your life is enhanced by Virgo's organized ways if you let them help you to categorize and order your surroundings. This can help you to be more productive so you can materialize your dreams and visions. If the Moon or Mars in your birth chart is in an earth sign, you'll better appreciate your Virgo mate's sense of practicality, which can enhance your chances for compatibility.\nMeanwhile, you help to open your Virgo lover's heart and teach them how to experience compassion and empathy. You learn how to think more clearly; he or she learns how to trust intuition and emotions. You both care deeply about service to others. Your spiritual compassion draws you into wanting to help those less fortunate than you. Virgo is service-oriented and needs to live a purposeful and meaningful life, which they can do while applying their efficiency to helping others.\nIf the two of you can find a common ground from which to operate, you'll be able to assist each other in the process of creating a life of goodwill and service, while growing personally into realms that are opposite your normal way of living.\n"}
