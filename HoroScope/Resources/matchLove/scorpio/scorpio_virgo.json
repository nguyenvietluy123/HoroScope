{"content":"You have a deep and personal interest in transformation and healing drawing on inner power to overcome emotional and physical trauma. It's as if you can transcend the boundaries of everyday living and mundane thought forms. When you put your mind to something, you can soar like an eagle into the heights, let go of the old patterns, thus experiencing self-empowerment from your rebirth.\nLike you, your Virgo partner has tremendous resources available to them and they will exert this power inwardly in order to overcome their own obstacles and challenges.\nVirgo's energy is more analytical and practical than yours. You tend to be more emotional and raw, unless your Moon or Mars is in an earth sign, grounding your feelings and increasing compatibility.\nThere is a deep respect between you and your partner and together you can make very good work allies, as you appreciate the careful order from which Virgo conducts the everyday routines of life. You bring your Virgo mate into a world of increased feeling and deepened passion, while he or she offers you a rational and logical way to work with your internal process of change.\nRomantically, you are both too hot for many people, and although your partner may seem cool and detached, he or she can focus passion like a laser. If Virgo's narrow beam of white hot intensity does not aim directly at you, it would be easy to miss it completely. But if the light of love shines your way, you two can cultivate long-lasting and mutually satisfying rhythms and routines that withstand the tests of time.\n"}
