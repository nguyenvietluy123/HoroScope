{"content":"Fire signs tend to work well with other fire signs, so this can be a good and lasting pair as long as there is plenty of excitement, romance, and play. Both of you love a good time and will put sports, adventure, and parties on top of your priority list.\nYou are impulsively active by nature, and may be inspired by your creative, expressive, and fun-loving Leo partner. You are more likely to follow a whim, and it will take a very secure Leo to trust you enough to give you the freedom you'll want. Meanwhile, your Lion is loyal and faithful, as long as he or she feels loved or even adored.\nYou both love to be the center of attention and would never turn your backs on an opportunity to be admired. There is no shortage of physical passion here, especially as a way to burn off excess anger. If, however, the Moon in your chart is in Taurus, Scorpio or Aquarius, compatibility may be more difficult to achieve.\nIt would be a good idea for you two limelight lovers to admire each other, express your love actively and avoid excessive competition. Long-term potentials include an active and joyous life of laughter, entertainment and love.\n"}
