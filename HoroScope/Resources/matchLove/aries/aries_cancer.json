{"content":"Your Aries folks have fiery Mars as your key or ruling planet. As such, you aren't eager to show your emotions. In fact, you take care of things by going into action mode rather than talk about your feelings. You are candid, spontaneous, and quick to recover from emotional setbacks. This is so very different than your Cancer partner, who is ruled by the watery Moon. They are deeply emotional, caring and highly sensitive. A natural tendency to nurture and protect their own feelings can cause them to withdraw from the playful and lighthearted whims that you Aries find so enjoyable.\nCancers may cramp your style, for they seem to worry about everything, while you'd rather do it now and worry about it later -- if ever at all. It's not all bleak, however. A good relationship is possible if you can learn to honor the sincere emotions of your Cancer friend, but, in turn, they must learn to respect your need to act spontaneously.\nIf Venus in your chart is in Pisces or Taurus, you will be better equipped to appreciate your lover. If your Moon is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), chances for compatibility are increased. Regardless of other planetary positions, this can be a dynamic relationship that pushes each of you into new ways of expressing your love.\n"}
