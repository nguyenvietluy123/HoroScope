{"content":"You make a very respectable pair. You are loyal, caring, and sensitive to the self-demanding and self-critical Virgo. Your soft and pliable ways offer a deeply soothing and reflective terrain for the busy Virgo mind. You have what it takes to coax your analytical Virgo out of their brain and into the cave of their heart. Your Virgo finds solace and sweetness here, and, in a surprising way, can be enticed to let down his or her guard. You make it safe for your partner to be less picky and judgmental than normal, allowing for a productive union to occur.\nThe two of you together can create a wonderful kitchen, work environment and home setting that is well-organized and lovingly arranged. For example, your kitchen might contain glass jars and containers, each labeled and arranged in perfect order. And then, there's the stack of mom's old-fashioned cookbooks. However, amongst all this apparent Virgo perfection, you will find ways to cook up plenty of homemade soups, cookies, and breads.\nThis can be a very nice union, but the position of Venus and Mars in your chart will be the determining factor as to whether you are compatible or not. Virgo's earthiness is appealing to your need for security, and this union can be successful if he or she isn't too critical of your ways.\n"}
