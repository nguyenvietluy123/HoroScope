{"content":"Glorious Leo! Your sign is ruled by the brilliant sun and you tend to be creative, generous, and open-hearted. You live to love and be loved. You relish basking in the limelight. You are much more vulnerable than others know, for your cheerful disposition and self- confidence is often misleading.\nYou give freely to those your love, but not without a catch. If your love is not returned with adoration, you will eventually retreat. When you team up with an Aries, you two fire signs can have a great time stirring up all kinds of enjoyment and activity. If, however, your Moon is in an earth sign, you'll tend to sacrifice pleasure for stability, which may scare off your impulsive Ram.\nYou both maintain a youthful attitude toward life and an enthusiastic exuberance when you are in love. But your Aries playmate can quickly tire of most any game, and it will be important for you to have new tricks up your sleeve to keep your lover's interest hot. You tend to be more loyal than the Ram, and it can be disconcerting to you when they don't follow through on their promises or plans. The two of you fun-loving mates are compatible and there is great passion between you.\nAries can be as self-centered and demanding as you, so together you will need to mature and balance your needs so each of you can have a turn at being \"the star.\" All in all, this is a high-spirited match worth pursuing.\n"}
