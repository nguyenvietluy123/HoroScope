{"content":"Your outgoing and fiery nature may be easily confused by Pisces, who in turn can be baffled by your relentless self-expression and readiness for action.\nCompared to the Fish, your ego is strong. You shine with self-confidence and a larger-than-life personal grandeur. You tend to think of yourself first, even though you can be extremely generous with loved ones. On the other hand, your Pisces lover is not particularly inclined to put self-interest first. They tend to be compassionate, gentle, and rarely put themselves on center stage, thus avoiding the spotlight.\nIn some ways, you Lions are a complete mystery to the Pisces Fish who experiences life from under the seas of imagination and spiritual, and through the undercurrents of feelings and sensitivity. Your Pisces mate expresses his or her sensitivity by way of humility, while you express your vulnerability by way of your showy pride. You fend off potential attack by roaring loudly, while your Fishy friend fears being eaten alive by the Lion. If, however, Venus in your chart is in Cancer or Virgo, you may be more mellow and therefore be more compatible with your Pisces lover.\nIn any case, you and your Pisces partner will need to find a genuine common ground from which to share your life if this is to be a solid and lasting union.\n"}
