{"content":"You are quite conservative, even traditional about finances, home security, and work. Sometimes you need a nudge from an outside source to free you from some of the restraints of your personal expectations of yourself and others. When you hook up with a freely thinking Aquarius individual who may be eccentric, independent, and original in their style of living, you are in for a surprise.\nYour Aquarius lover can be rebellious and radical-and is not intimidated by the confines of rules and regulations. You, on the other hand live within the bounds of the law and expect others to do the same. But your out-of-the-box Aquarius partner presents a convincing case for some rule-bending. They have an urge to pave a liberated path into the future, and you are intrigued by the prospects of taking that road with them.\nIt certainly would help if the Moon in your chart is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius). Better yet, with your Mercury or Venus in Aquarius, you will easily accept the brilliance of your unrestrained mate.\nNo matter what, your view of the world is about to be expanded and changed as you are drawn into a new way of looking at your life. You may need to rearrange your old way of thinking and \"let go\" of tried and true concepts that have worked for you. You'll need to be willing to adapt to new ideas if you are to be compatible with a typical Aquarius partner. On the other side of it, your lover must respect your boundaries and agree to adhere to some of the traditional values you so deeply cherish.\nTogether, you can be good friends, although your ways may never quite come together. Nonetheless, you can be very good friends, even long-term lovers as you create a stable and mature relationship based upon freedom and mutual respect.\n"}
