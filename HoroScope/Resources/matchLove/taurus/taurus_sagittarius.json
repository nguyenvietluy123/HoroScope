{"content":"You're going to have to make a number of adjustments for this relationship to work. Generally speaking, you tend to move slower than goal-oriented Sagittarius.\nYour solid, down-to-earth, no-nonsense personality can offer your Sagittarian lover a potential for stability and focus regarding the practical side of life. On the other hand, you can seem like a party spoiler as you try to simplify your adventurous partner's life. Under your steadfast influence, the restless archer will either settle down or soon be tempted to point his or her arrow in the direction of bigger dreams and greener pastures.\nYou may lack understanding or acceptance of your partner's goals that seek greater horizons and unknown vistas. You'd rather create a solid life built upon real pleasure and security. If, however, you have Venus or Mercury in Aries, you'll be better equipped to accompany your lover in whatever adventures he or she dreams up. But if you have the Moon or Mars in Virgo or Pisces, there may be stressful differences that are tough to overcome.\nNo matter what planetary pressures are placed upon you as a couple, with some flexibility you'll be able to dance and dream as you pave a real road toward a rich and adventuresome life.\n"}
