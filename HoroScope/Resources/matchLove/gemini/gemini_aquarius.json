{"content":"You love to talk about almost anything, and probably know a little bit about practically everything in the world. Your Aquarian lover, however, may know everything. So, although the two of you can have a wonderful intellectual rapport and love to communicate, your styles are different. You are more flexible.\nYour Aquarian mate can be rather rigid. Nonetheless, you like being with your partner, and don't tire of the repartee. Ultimately, you are compatible with Aquarius and can create strong bonds that make you the very best of friends. You are usually willing to engage in fun and entertaining activities, and your Aquarius mate is a great comrade who is willing and ready to try pretty much anything new and different.\nYou have a persuasive affect on your Aquarius ally and may attempt to talk him or her into delving into previously unexplored avenues. Together, your agile minds prefer to widen the vision by engaging in such topics as outer space, science fiction or anything unusual and intellectually stimulating. This is an enduring platonic union that can turn into romance if the physical attraction is passionate.\nIt will probably take strong connections between Venus and Mars in your compatibility chart for this relationship to develop in the physical and romantic realms.\n"}
