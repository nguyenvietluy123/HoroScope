{"content":"You are a water sign. Your key planet is Neptune, the god of the seas. You live in a diffused ocean of feeling world and have an innate ability to understand the world with compassion and empathy. Your love for animals, children and nature has no bounds.\nWhen you hook up with a Cancer, you meet a long-lost friend, for the Crab is also a water sign, connected with the Moon. The Moon symbolizes the changing tides of emotions and as such, your nurturing Cancer lover may exhibit changeable moods. Crabs and Fish are made for one another and you'll find it easy to share the same pond. Cancers are homebodies who need a warm and cozy home in which to thrive. Together, you are comfortable with your feelings and show tender care to one another, family and friends.\nOne area of concern is that you may lack the ability to deal with real word issues, preferring to retreat into your private world. Your acute sensitivity to your lover's moods can actually drive you to the depths of despair. But, with the Moon or Mars in a fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius) or in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), you'll inspire your worrisome partner to move beyond his or her emotional restraints, which in turn frees you from your depression.\nIf you and your Crab decide to go for it, you'll create a lovely home, full of sensitive children, an overflowing garden and lots of art. Your mate is a natural in the kitchen and may provide the food while you tend to the other things that make your home a magical place. This can be one of the best unions, as both of you are willing and eager to share your innermost self with each another, thereby providing a context from which you can engage the routines and tests of the real world.\n"}
