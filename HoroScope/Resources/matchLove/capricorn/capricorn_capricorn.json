{"content":"When two of the same signs meet, there can be immediate chemistry and familiarity-for you both have similar natures. Each of you, however, funnels the basic Capricorn qualities in a different manner. The undercurrents of your demeanor, however, are familiar to each other and this can be a reassuring place from which to begin a relationship.\nYou probably share a fundamental appreciation for one another's organizational capabilities and you respect each other's responsible manner of living. You tend to be a controlling type, often portraying a \"take charge\" kind of personality. You may not appear to be overt and outwardly aggressive, but inwardly you are stern and, more often than not, clear about your boundaries of authority and power.\nPut two of you together in the same home or same bed, and you're going to need to find a manageable balance of power, taking turns to give and take as a way of sharing the lead. You may need to find ways to bring good humor into your relationship so as to elevate some of the burden you both carry. You'll also need to incorporate play into your everyday life.\nIn this relationship, the placement of the Moon, Venus and Mars can make or break compatibility. If you share air sign placements, you will tend to be more light-hearted and talk about your situations as a way of dissipating the heaviness. If these planets are in fire signs, you'll probably move into action and work through your fears instead of talking about them.\nCapricorns are usually stellar parents, teachers, public leaders, and make good coaches and guides. Together, you will create a stable home that is ordered and managed with discipline and love.\n"}
