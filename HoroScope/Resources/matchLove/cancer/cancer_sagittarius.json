{"content":"Your passive and sensitive demeanor may be agitated by the restless and expansive nature of Sagittarius, who often looks to participate in new adventures far away from home. And, of course, you Crabs would rather not leave the comforts of your own cave. In this relationship, you can provide the secure home base for the goal-oriented archer. Your partner can appreciate the loving environment you offer. Don't, however, expect him or her to hang their coat and hat for too long. Sagittarius needs the freedom to come and go on journeys-whether in the outer world or in the realm of philosophy and ideas.\nYou will be offered the opportunity to do more and to become more of a traveler. On the other side of it, your lover can learn virtues regarding stability, security, and emotional honesty. This isn't an easy union, and will require a high level of compromise unless your Moon is in a fire sign or air sign.\nIf you can find a way to allow for your differences in lifestyle, you can share in interests that involve global networking, foreign travel (or even making a home abroad) and exotic cooking. You'll need to spice up your life to fit your optimistic mate's bill of standards. And he or she will need to pull in their reigns, create a workable strategy in regard to domestic issues and be willing to take the time needed to coax you out of your shell.\n"}
