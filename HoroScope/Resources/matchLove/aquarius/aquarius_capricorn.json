{"content":"Although you are inventive, original and eccentric, you live according to a set of values that are based on humanity rather than individuality. You can be less self-centered than other signs, and remain caring and compassionate as you pursue resolution to world conflict and community dissonance. You have an advantage to the degree that you are able to remain detached from heated debates and controversy. In fact, you may avoid confrontation, especially when emotions are flying about.\nCapricorns are dignified and quiet in their pursuit of purpose and accomplishment. They, too, are not overtly emotional, often appearing cold or distant in personal situations. One area of challenge in your relationship with a serious Capricorn would be the feeling world, since you each-for different reasons-may choose to avoid the emotional realms.\nYou may find your sure-footed Goat too conservative for your non-traditional tastes, while he or she thinks you are weird. On the other hand, if you can learn to appreciate the stability he or she may offer, you'll actually be more able to live your life on the edge. Of course, you'll need an exceptional Capricorn-one who won't judge your tendency to throw away the past in order to embrace the future. The good news is that you two can maintain a high degree of respect for one another, although you may find it difficult to express tender affection and vulnerable feelings with each other.\nIf you have the Moon in an earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn) or in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), your chances for compatibility is increased.\nThis is not an easy relationship. It can, however, be successful and long-lasting if you each can get past your fears about your basic differences of style. You must express your respect and love to each other, thereby allowing trust to develop and overcome your differences.\n"}
