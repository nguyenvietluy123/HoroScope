Otherwise, your may feel like you are lacking purpose and become intolerant of yourself and others.\nIn many ways, Leos are your opposite. They love the fanfare of dramatic and colorful exhibition. They need the group, not to feel a part of it, but to be recognized and appreciated by it. Leos typically will join in the greater collective as long as they have a special place to shine. Put them on center stage, while you may be happier in advertising or technical support. Your Leo lover needs your ongoing approval in order to continue to thrive.\nOn the other hand, you tend to be self-motivating and may not be interested in fluffing the feathers of the Leo's ego needs.

If the Moon or Mars in your chart is in a fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), your chances for compatibility are improved as you will tend to share more activities and interests.\nUltimately, you can learn to advance your creative skills while learning from the expressive and warm-hearted Leo. This is a dynamic relationship that can combine your two very different individual lifestyles into a solid and enduring partnership.\n"}
