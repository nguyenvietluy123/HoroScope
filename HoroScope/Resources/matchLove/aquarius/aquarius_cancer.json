You enjoy the electric buzz of groups and you thrive on the dynamics of intellectual exchange and mutual friendship. It is true that you can be an outstanding friend, yet in relationships, you can maintain an emotional distance so as not to become emerged in the other person's feelings. While you prefer to remain aloof and carefree, your Cancer lover needs close emotional contact and reassurance.\n The Moon is the key planet of Cancer, which binds them to their emotions, draws them into sensitive encounters with loved ones and family, and requires them to feel their changing moods like the Crab watches for the changing tide. Your Cancer lover can easily give emotional support to those around them, but finds it difficult to ask for what they need.\n Obviously, there are some differences between the two of you and you'll each need to adjust your basic nature in order to maintain a solid and loving rapport. You may not show your emotions outwardly, choosing to hold your feelings within. Even with their hard outer shells, Cancers cannot hide their feelings and tend to cry more easily than others. Your partner may be confused by your emotionally distant ways, which can make him or her feel insecure. Meanwhile, you may find your mate simply needs too much emotional attention. If Venus in your chart is in Pisces or if the Moon is in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), then you will feel more comfortable hanging out in the emotional realms with your lover.\nIf you can get past your fear of emotional attachment so you can strike a balance in this relationship, the two of you can create a unique home with unusual d\u00e9cor, fine detail, and may enjoy the virtues of a progressive and uplifting family life.\n"}
