{"content":"You adore elegant objects that represent fine taste and a sense of beauty. You have the ability to transform your environment into a haven of peace, relaxation, and harmony. Scorpio's resourceful and magnetic personality would just love to bask in the sheer elegance of your domain. Your Scorpio lover may enjoy the opportunity to indulge you with the physical pleasures and emotional passions of life while you adorn your Scorpio with appreciation and adoration.\nThe problem, however, is that you may find your Scorpio partner way more intense than you think anyone should ever need to be. You may be attracted by the Scorpio's charisma and want to understand the mysteries behind the veil, but as you open the curtain, you may not like what you see.\nIf the Moon in your chart is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you'll be better equipped to react to the powerful Scorpion's emotions, but if your Moon is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), you'd better run for the hills while you still have a chance.\nYou are happiest when everything in your environment is in harmony. Your Scorpio lover is happiest when passions are running high and the feelings are mutual. If you are willing to take a journey into the shadowy realms of emotions, where things aren't always as pleasant as you'd like, you just may find more beauty and magic than you though possible.\n"}
