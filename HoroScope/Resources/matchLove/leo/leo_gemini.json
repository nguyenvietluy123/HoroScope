{"content":"You love most playful aspects of life. Your naturally sunny disposition gives you charisma that can light up a room as you enter it. You can be very personable, as long as you feel that you are receiving your fair share of attention and recognition. You readily share the center stage with others as long as you get to be the star.\nYour Gemini partner is motivated by communication and you can be entranced by their wit, charm, and delightful banter. When you are in a relationship with Gemini, a powerful and magnetic attraction takes place that lifts both of your spirits and heightens your mutual curiosity about each other and the world. You make great playmates, in life, at work or in bed. Creative sparks fly if you learn to play well and communicate with equal respect for each other's need for attention and approval.\nIf your Venus is in Virgo, you think your Gemini friend is a bit too scattered. If your Venus is in Cancer, he or she may be a bit too noisy for you. But with your Venus in Gemini or Leo, you will experience a loving bond.\nThe bottom line is that you may not be as natural with words and language as your lover is, but as a talented performers or artist, you really know how to put on a show. Together, you can be extremely creative and productive, while having more than your fair share of fun along the way.\n"}
