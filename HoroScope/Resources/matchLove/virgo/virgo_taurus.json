{"content":"You and Taurus can make a great pair, for you find a real companion in the Bull who compliments your analytical style with common sense. You are both earth signs and can encourage productivity in each other, especially in the realm of business and practical matters concerning home and family.\nYour heightened sense of perfectionism blends very well with the artistic and sensual tastes of your Taurus lover. If, however, your Venus is in Leo or Libra, you may have ongoing disagreements about what you each consider tasteful.\nIn Taurus, you find someone who can create an environment that is clean, well organized, and simplistically beautiful. Your partner will probably pay attention to money-balancing your frugal ways with their abundant desires. Your nature-loving Taurus will most likely also enjoy camping and outdoor hikes, and if they do love the outdoors, they may actually incorporate natural and earthy themes in home decor, including lots of plants and a useful vegetable garden.\nThis is a no-nonsense, down-to-earth match which can survive the toughest of times and thrive for many happy years.\n"}
