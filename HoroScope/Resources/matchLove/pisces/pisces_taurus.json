{"content":"You go with the flow, enabling you to get along with people who are more headstrong than yourself. You sympathize with others and have a broad spectrum of understanding. In relationships, you need to hold your own power so that others can't take advantage of your sweet and kind nature. You quickly learn that you do not have the same stubborn personality as the Taurus man or woman in your life, but always giving in to their needs may feed your sense of victimization or martyrdom.\nTaurus Bulls are mighty in their pursuit of accomplishment. They love to feel as though they possess everything around them. They can be unusually simplistic and opinionated regarding their personal needs and security, and tend toward having an unyielding type of personality. Actually, this all bodes well for you and you are willing to throw your lot in with your Taurus lover. You admire his or her stability and ability to work in the real world, yet you also appreciate the underlying attraction of sensuality and beauty.\nYou have a tremendous flow with Taurus, seeing in them the virtue of fine values and tastes. You are able to move through the currents of their stubborn nature with uncanny grace and intuition. Your Taurus partner is a loving sign by nature, enjoying your gentle compassion. He or she is less threatened by you than by other signs and is able to soften in your presence and to surrender to your emotional needs.\nYour chance for compatibility is increased if your chart has Venus in Capricorn or the Moon in any earth sign (Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn). The two of you can create a loving home that is beautifully constructed and decorated. You'll let your Taurus mate take charge of the practical side of furnishings and decorations, while your role will be to keep the peace in the family.\nAs romantic partners, you two can be very compatible, bringing sensual and emotional enjoyment to each other in a lasting relationship.\n"}
