{"content":"You are an original and independent person, who needs to make your own contribution to the common good. You can be fun-loving and friendly in a quirky unemotional, impersonal, intellectual way. You may be motivated by your enjoyment of group activities within a circle of friends. You have a strong mind and are often at the cutting edge of technology, spirituality and culture. Fireworks can go off when you get together with an impulsive Aries, who may be as innovative and independent as you. Aries partners are nearly always ready for a new project or enterprise. Just say the word and they are ready to go. They are cheerful as well, and prefer to project a courageous and happy disposition to the world.\n Sometimes, however, their independence can get in the way of harmonious interactions in a group situation for they like to do things in their own way and at their own pace. You may get frustrated with your Aries lover, especially when he or she is being headstrong and exhibiting impatience with you or others.\n Although you two are typically compatible, this trait can make it tough for you to work together well with mutual interest. You each enjoy the pleasure of self-motivated adventures. You, however, may be more inclined to the group setting, while your mate may seek to go it alone. This dilemma can get in the way, especially when you are creating your social calendar. If you have Venus in Capricorn or Pisces, this problem can become difficult to resolve, although your Moon in an fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius) can increase compatibility.\n Together, you make an exciting and active couple, for neither of you is likely to stay put for too long. Your Aries lover will certainly challenge you to pay attention to other people's points of view on a personal level. You have great potential if you can learn to deal with the simple practicalities of everyday life as you bridge the future of humanity with your individual needs of the moment.\n"}
