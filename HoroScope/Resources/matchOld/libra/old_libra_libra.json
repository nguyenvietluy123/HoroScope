{"content":"Libra-Libra Compatibility \nLibrans are very cheerful, polite and generous people. They have a charismatic personality and are able to keep people under their spell. Librans will make their partner happy by their gregarious and cheerful nature. However, Librans are very sensitive and indecisive. Sometimes, they find themselves in very jolly mood and at other times dull and glum. They are also inclined towards the artistic forms of work and intelligence of other people. Everything is wonderful with Librans only if they know how to keep the balance.\n\nLibra Man and Libra Woman \nThe Compatibility between a Libra man and a Libra woman may not reach to the peak. The major drawback in keeping-up the relationship for life-long is that both of them have similar traits as well as lack the same qualities which are required to keep the balance in the relationship. The Libra women are generally very loyal and sincere whereas the Libra men are affectionate and sensitive. None of the partner will dominate but to make the marriage sustainable both need to respect and understand each other.\n"}
