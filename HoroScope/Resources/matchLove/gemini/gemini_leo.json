{"content":"Let's face it: you love to flirt and play. The good news is that your Leo mate loves to be flirted with and adored. The playful Lion is usually ready for a good time, but will separate work and play more than you do. If you can find a way to bring lighthearted fun into your time together, you can be highly compatible.\nYour habit of looking over the fence for greener pastures will not bode well with the possessive Leo, who needs to be the center of your world, along with plenty of immediate attention and applause. You'll have to beware not to hurt your proud Lion's feelings by flaunting interest elsewhere or your Leo will retreat. If your Venus is in Leo, this may not be a problem.\nOn the upside, your partner will always communicate through his or her heart with generosity and love. There aren't many things better than being loved by a Leo when they are bestowing their grace upon you. Your keen mental wit is attractive to the Leo, but your sarcasm may be too much at times. The long term possibilities here may rest on your willingness to learn the virtues of loving communication.\n"}
