{"content":"When you are comfortable, you are very easy to be around. And with Cancer the Crab, you can find a natural comfort zone which can lull you into an easy relaxation.\nYou are drawn toward the domestic behaviors of Cancer and can be the happy recipient of their cooking, homemaking and nurturing, whether they are male or female. In fact, since you like to treat your senses well, the two of you living together would most likely create a magnificent kitchen and a comfortable living space. The culinary delights that might come from your kitchen are viewed as caring and nurturing by your Cancer partner, but you simply love to eat what is prepared, no matter what the motivation is for preparing it.\nYou are willing and capable to provide a steady and stable foundation for the security-bound Cancer and they, in turn, happily offer you a safe comfortable haven. Your lover may seem emotionally needy, unless your Moon or Mars is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces).\nThere is a high degree of trust that exists between you two and if you establish harmony early in your relationship, you can remain together for a lifetime.\n"}
