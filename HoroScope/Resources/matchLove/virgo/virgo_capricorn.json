{"content":"You are normally hesitant in your actions until you know that everything is proper. Your Capricorn lover is also conservative in action and carefully sets goals and then sets out to achieve them. You are both cautious about matters of the heart. You tend toward critical and analytical thinking, and bring a sharp flavor of communication into relationships.\nTo others, you can appear cool and distant with your discerning eye. This works well with your Goat, for Capricorn is also well-guarded at the beginning of a relationship. Capricorns do not wear their heart on their sleeve and can hold back feelings until it appears very safe.\nYour partner is probably more serious than you are. Both of you are practical and down to earth, each in your own unique way. If Venus in your chart is in Leo, you might find your mate's seriousness just too much. If your Venus is in Libra, you may not be as attracted to your Capricorn's belief that practicality is more important that beauty.\nNo matter where the other planets are in your chart, your organizational abilities should blend nicely with Capricorn's ordered, but sometimes controlling, way of life. For the most part, you'll enjoy sharing the same space and can easily adjust to each other's needs and habits. Romantic fires may take awhile to get roaring, however, both of you can be very affectionate and sexy once you've moved past your issues of trust and have learned how to share.\n"}
