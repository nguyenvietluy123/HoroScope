{"content":"You Sagittarians are quite resourceful and able to gather information and materials that you need for your projects and goals. You make fine teachers, life-long students and can excel in the fields of law and politics.\nScorpios are cosmically programmed to research and delve into situations with a keen ability to solve problems and unravel mysteries. They are attracted to your big thinking and may be inspired by your philosophical ideas.\nTogether, you can enjoy mutual studies, movies and discussing world current events. You'll need to share interests like these, for other areas of your relationship may be more difficult because of how differently you approach life.\nYou are basically optimistic and can, to a fault, always see the brighter side of a situation. Your Scorpio partner may perceive this Pollyanna-type behavior as naive. He or she will want to wallow around in the darker side of affairs. Scorpios aren't necessarily pessimistic; they just won't be satisfied glossing over that which is unpleasant.\nIf you have Venus in Scorpio, or the Moon in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you may be more open to dig into the irrational and passionate world of your mate's intense feelings.\nTogether, you may be able to cultivate each other's hidden talents that can motivate personal growth and enrich your lives. No matter what else, you'll have to learn the fine art of listening so that your Scorpio lover feels like he or she is being heard, for trust is a necessary part of this relationship. Engaging in shared interests is the key to a successful union.\n"}
