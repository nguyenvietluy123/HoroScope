{"content":"You are as reflective, analytical and refined as your Libra lover and can get along famously, as long as Libra isn't too wishy-washy when it comes to making decisions. You'll probably get annoyed with the indecision of your partner, who would rather avoid picking one option over another. Libra will feel pressured by you, even if you don't mean it.\nLibra will feel judged under your critically discerning eye. But it's not just about making decisions. You may also be critical of their laziness. And, unless you have Mercury or Venus in Libra in your chart, you'll probably think your Libra mate isn't very practical ... and they are not!\nThey are more interested in aesthetics than utility. Libra will want the walls painted white because it looks better, but you'll want them a light ivory because it won't show up dirt as quickly. Actually, you are both keen on beauty and balance, and can build a lovely environment that others find refreshing, clean, and stimulating.\nTogether you can manifest prosperity and indulge in the finer things in life. With some individual adjustments, this can be a compatible relationship with good potential.\n"}
