{"content":"You are tactful, well-mannered and have a high-strung nervous system. You find much comfort within the protective sphere of a Cancer mate.\nYou are apt to set the foundation for the home on the material plane by organizing and tidying up the environment. Your Cancer lover will warm and soften your cool aesthetic tastes with photos of friends, cozy blankets on chairs, and emotionally nurturing family memorabilia. The two of you must find a balance, however, because your Crab is sentimental and in holding onto the past, can create clutter. You prefer neat and clean spaces -- except when it's your own clutter, which is not a mess; just an organized pile.\nAlthough you bring a rational point of view to your partner, they may not be as impressed with facts and figures as you are. This makes you crazy, for the emotionally-driven Cancers are more concerned with their gut intuition, and all the logic in the world isn't going to change their minds. If, however, the Moon in your chart is in a water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you may acknowledge the supremacy of intuition over logic.\nNonetheless, communication flows well between you two and you'll be able to create many fond memories.\n"}
