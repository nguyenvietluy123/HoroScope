{"content":"Leo-Leo Compatibility \nLions have the tendency to be warm, eloquent,romantic and passionate. They crave for appreciation and always like to show 'larger-than-life' image. Humbleness and modesty are not their cup of tea. A Leo is trustworthy and loyal but usually are prone to vainglory, rigidness and self-indulgence. Their passionate and romantic nature helps them in love relationship though they share a good compatibility with a very few signs. \n\nLeo Man and Leo Woman \nA Leo is a self-centred individual. As both of them want to be the center of attraction and they always try to dominate each other. This compatibility will either result in a great success or a disaster because of their opposite nature. This zodiac match will not work well if any one of them tries to dominate the other. The compatibility can be good only when both the zodiac signs can trust and value each other's perspectives.\n"}
