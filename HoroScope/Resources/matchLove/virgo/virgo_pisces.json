{"content":"Sometimes opposites do attract and no doubt about it: Pisces is your opposite. You are exacting and disciplined where Pisces can be scattered and spacey. You are rational and logical while Pisces is imaginative and emotional. You respond to circumstances of life by narrowing your focus and analyzing the details as you figure out your next move. Your Pisces lover discards the obvious facts while searching the inner dimensions of spirit, relying on intuition instead of data.\nIf the Moon in your chart is in a water sign, then you'll be more open to the imaginal realms of your Pisces. If the Moon in your chart is in an earth sign, you may think that Pisces is just too flaky for your taste.\nYou may get annoyed at what you consider escapist tendencies in your lover, although he or she may not see it that way at all. If, however, you can accept how different the two of you are, you can actually be of great help to each, as you balance each other and bring into focus the areas of life that are weak for each of you. In fact, you can serve as mirrors to each other's souls.\nMost importantly, this relationship softens you and teaches you how to become more compassionate and caring for others. You are a practical person, yet matters of the heart-especially with a Pisces-are not necessarily rational. On the other hand, you can teach your fishy friend some tricks of your own and they can learn how to productively organize their life. Together, you can be very sweet and loving, with a great fondness for lovely walks, enjoyable music and quiet times.\n"}
