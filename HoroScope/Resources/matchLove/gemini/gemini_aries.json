{"content":"Your spontaneity mixes well with action-oriented Aries, making a lighthearted and congenial couple. You both usually choose to experience the brighter side of life. Together you contribute your share of delightfulness to the world around you.\nCommunication is very important to you and, in many ways you actually express your love through ideas and the words used to share them. Your Aries lover, on the other hand, is less inclined to intellectualism and is more tactile and immediate. He or she expresses devotion and love through their willingness to participate and promote pioneering projects with their loved one. Your Aries partner will need some independence and your comings and goings should provide them with enough so they don't feel too constrained by the demands of the relationship.\nWill this one last? It's hard to tell, but one thing is certain. You're going to have to make things feel new and exciting for your Aries to hold interest. If your love planet, Venus, is in Aries, then this won't be a problem. You'll be exciting without even trying.\nIt may take some effort to create long term stability, but you and your Aries friend can inspire each other to invent new and potent ways to express ideas and to lead the way toward a life that you both can enjoy.\n"}
