{"content":"You love to solve mysteries and delve deeply into the affairs of others, sometimes even without their knowledge. You are a natural detective who enjoys unraveling a puzzling situation, which is partly why you are drawn toward suspense and powerful emotional drama.\nThe keen intellect and sharp wit of your Gemini partner appreciates these qualities in you and may actually enjoy sharing ideas and debating issues with you, but they are no match for your intensity. In fact, you just may scare the heck out of them. While Gemini is attracted to the display of fireworks, you are more concerned with what is fueling the volcano. You just may be too serious for Gemini.\nIf, however, your chart has the Moon in an air sign or if Venus is in Libra or Sagittarius, compatibility is more likely.\nYour clever Gemini may have a half-passionate, half-intellectual approach to affairs of the heart-creating a romantic interlude that includes discussions about the unknown mysteries of life. The biggest obstacle that you'll need to overcome is that your Gemini mate is flighty and casually flirtatious, which will stir up your issues of jealousy and possessiveness.\nYou will each have some adjustments to make in order to create a harmonious relationship with each another.\n"}
