{"content":"Libra is the sign that is exactly opposite you in the zodiac, and as the old saying goes, \"opposites attract.\" You are like opposite sides of the same coin, but of course, this means that you share the same coin.\nYou are naturally more interested in personal matters of the ego. Your Libra partner is probably more curious about what others think and do. You operate in terms of self-motivating desires while your partner learns about their own self through other people's experiences and ideas. As you Aries tend to be quite independent, your Libra is wired for relationships and loves to relate others. Together you balance each other and tend to blend well.\nIf the Moon or Mars in your chart is in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius) compatibility will be easier as you better relate to the intellectual aspects of your lover. No matter what the other planets add into the mix, your involvement with a Libra can teach you the virtue of relationships, valuable people skills and flexibility.\n"}
