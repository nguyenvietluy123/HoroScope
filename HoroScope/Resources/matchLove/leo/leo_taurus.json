{"content":"You are one of the four fixed signs of the zodiac, along with Taurus, Scorpio and Aquarius. When you meet up with another strong individual such as a Taurus, you will each have to learn to give and take within the boundaries of the relationship.\nYou have a big and tender heart, giving generously to your partner as long as you are receiving plenty of love, affection and attention in return. Your Taurus lover seeks simple pleasures and can be very sensual. The Bull is ruled by the planet Venus, which places a tremendous emphasis on the value of love. The two of you come together with a strong sense of love already established within. The work is to become receptive and open to the needs of the other. In this way, both of your unique ways of sharing affection can be readily accepted by each other.\nYou need a lot of attention. Taurus needs a lot of touch. You both have the capacity for unwavering loyalty in love, but you also each can be quite stubborn in your own individual ways. Without relief from harmonious placements of the Moon, Venus or Mars, your relationship can turn into a battleground where there will be no winner.\nUltimately, if you can get past your own self interests and learn to give freely to your Taurus mate, this can be a dynamic match with lots of material abundance and goodwill.\n"}
