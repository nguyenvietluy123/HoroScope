{"content":"You are cautious, responsible and serious. Typically, you are not overly emotional, tending to hold back your feelings. You are practical, preferring traditional and conservative friends and family circles. In a relationship, you are the stable one, willing to work on making it last.\nBeing in a relationship with a fiery Aries can be unnerving as they are often very impulsive and will jump right into a job, creative project or relationship without thinking it through first. You, on the other hand, will make a plan, build your foundation and then execute your plan accordingly. The haste of Aries' endeavors may cause them to lose sight of the finer details that lead to completion.\nIn fact, you'll probably feel like you are playing a parental role to your excitable Aries lover, who could seem annoyingly childlike in demeanor, especially when they don't finish what they started.\nIf, however, you have the Moon or Mars in a fire sign, you'll be ready to jump in and help, rather than scolding them. Eventually your fiery Aries lover may feel regularly thwarted by your stern eye.\nAt the same time, you tire of feeling like you need to watch after your Aries, for it seems like your sensible supervision keeps them out of trouble. But in love and marriage, your practical maturity can, in fact, help your Aries mate take responsibility more seriously. And you have much to gain as he or she can spark up the boring routines in your world.\nThis match works as long as you are willing to let go of control issues, thereby allowing your independent partner enough room to feel like there is a balance of power.\n"}
