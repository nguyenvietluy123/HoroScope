{"content":"You can merge with your Gemini into a happy couple -- enjoying the beautiful and refined aspects of life. You may struggle to remain focused and grounded together, for as two air signs, you tend toward living in an idealistic world of ideas and dreams that can fail to produce results and practical success in the real world.\nIf either of you have the Moon, Mercury, Venus or Mars in earth signs, you will be better equipped to deal with the day-to-day responsibilities of living.\nWithout other planets in earth signs, yours is a mental relationship, so communication is of key importance to both of you. Your Gemini lover will stimulate your creativity, inspiring you to greater heights of expression. You, on the other hand, will help your clever Gemini to incorporate an artistic grace in what they say or write. Together, you are dreamers and schemers, and will love to delve into the infinite possibilities that lay before you.\nOne romantic aspect of this union may include writing poems, letters or emails to each another and creating lovely things of beauty to give each other as gifts. You may have found yourself a lifelong playmate, lover and friend, and together you will keep each other young at heart.\n"}
