{"content":"Boundary issues are sometimes difficult for you Pisces folks. You can lose yourself into someone else's life and can sacrifice much in order to help your partner in any way you can. Typically, you are not selfish, stingy or obstinate. Your intuitive guidance and empathy can help to heal the emotional, spiritual or physical wounds of your friends, family and work associates.\nWhen you hook up with a Libra, you can initially feel as if you've met someone who is as good at relationships as you are, but Libras are air signs, and as such can be emotionally detached. This doesn't feel right to you, for you live your life swimming in a sea of feelings and when they are taken away, you can feel like a fish out of water. If, however, you have the Moon or Mars in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius) it may be easier for you to accept the easy-going non-emotional style of your Libra lover.\nYour Libra partner will need to feel united with you as part of a team. If you do have areas of common interest or if you appreciate similar artistic expressions, the two of you can be very good mates together because you both desire assisting those you love. Libras are fair and conscientious, with refined tastes and aesthetic values. You are surely attuned to the sublime and beautiful, and do want a partner who can appreciate the finer things in life.\nTogether, you are not overly materialistic but probably will live in nice surroundings. You'll dance in the luminescent glow of human emotion and artistry, leading each other into a life of greater awareness as you share music, art, poetry and spiritual pursuits.\n"}
