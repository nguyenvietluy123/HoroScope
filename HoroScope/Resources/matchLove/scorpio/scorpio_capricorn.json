{"content":"Privacy and self-preservation play a significant role in your life. You aren't inclined to casually blurt out feelings or opinions when in the company of groups, new friends, or professional settings. However intense and passionate your feelings, you keep your thoughts to yourself-revealing little of your internal life until you fully trust the people around you.\nCapricorns display similar behavior, although for different reasons. They, too, portray a cautious and reserved demeanor, holding their feelings in deep reserve, but for the Goat, it is about doing what is right. Sharing feelings in many situations is just inappropriate for them.\nFor you, it's more about trust. No matter what the motivation, when paired with a Capricorn, you each respect one another's personal space, allowing room for process, restoration and rejuvenation. Unless you have the Moon or Venus in an earth sign, you might find the Capricorn too dry and lacking of emotion.\nBut don't let that cool exterior fool you. Capricorn learns the steps and then can dance with total abandon. As you teach your lover how to explore the depths of feelings, he or she will follow your lead.\nCapricorns are very special love mates, preferring to display affection and sensuality within the confines of their own seclusion. There can be great chemistry between you two, and the sex can register quite high on the Richter scale. If you are both willing to trust the open channels of communication, this can be a lasting and loving union.\n"}
