{"content":"Sagittarius-Cancer Compatibility \nSagittarius are simple, straightforward and intelligent people. Cancerians are vulnerable and empathetic. Sagittarians are blunt and don't understand Cancerian's emotional feelings. They will provide Cancerians with comfort and pleasure via their good sense of humour and friendliness but will be unable to understand a Cancerian's mood swings. Sagittarius are also fond of wandering which is just opposite to a Cancerian's desire of staying back at home. These clashes can be minimized by mutual understanding. \n\nSagittarius Man and Cancer Woman \nThis love match has great chances of making a happy couple. But for that to happen both the individuals need to make the right efforts. A Sagittarius man will have to learn to be little responsible and start loving his family and home. On the other hand, a Cancer woman will have to be little adventurous and at times gel herself into the activities that interests a Sagittarius man. Though it is not one of the fine matches, but is still workable if one of them is determined to do so.\n\nSagittarius Woman and Cancer Man \nThe love match of a Cancer man with a Sagittarius woman is unlikely but not impossible. By working on their differences the pair may compliment each other. If a Cancer man dwells himself into the activities that gives happiness to a Sagittarius woman and in turn a Sagittarius woman shows love and affection towards him and his family then the couple may avoid any kind of hurdles coming in their path of a successful life together.\n"}
