Leos love going out on the town, creative arts and playful excursions of most any type.\nNeedless to say, these traits complement your sense of adventure, allowing the two of you to enjoy your mutual companionship a great deal. Your Lion lights the way for playful interludes while you are busy planning your next big expedition.
