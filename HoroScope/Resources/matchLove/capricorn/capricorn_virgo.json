{"content":"When two earth signs hook up, there is an immediate and basic similarity in the way you value things that are real, including your jobs, financial responsibilities and basic needs such as food and shelter. You are hard working and remain committed and devoted to a task until it's finished. You cherish quality, honesty, and order.\nThese attitudes toward life are compatible with your Virgo partner, who may be more service-oriented than you, but is also responsible, dutiful and efficient. Together, you may enjoy studying, collecting or gardening, and may share a fondness of nature and the outdoors.\nYou enjoy achieving the goals you set out to attain, especially when you need to work hard to fulfill your dream. Your Virgo partner is a consistent worker, who may not have your managerial skills, but who can attend to the details of a high profile job or running a household.\nIn a partnership, your Virgo can assist you greatly. If, however, the Moon or Mars in your chart is in Gemini or Pisces, you may find that you sometimes are working at cross-purposes.\nAlone, your mate is efficient and stable, but when coupled with you, mountains will be moved as you pave your road into the future with logic and hard work. Together, you make a home that works, and that has a sense of practical efficiency reflecting the nature of your mutual love.\n"}
