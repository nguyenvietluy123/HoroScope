{"content":"These two earth signs are very compatible and tend to complement the virtue of hard work, stability, and patience within each other. There are, however, significant differences.\nYou love the green, moist, lush earth while the Capricorn may be drawn toward mountains, the dry desert, and canyons. In other words, you may exhibit more feeling and emotion than your cautious Capricorn who tends to hold feelings inside. Trouble may arise as your partner tries to take the role of authoritarian or exude more of a need to take control over situations. You'll probably go along with this to a point, just as long as you get your way on important matters of the heart. You will trust your partner when it comes to making decisions about practical matters, but you won't want them to pick out the furnishings for your home or the linens. You want things that indulge your senses, while they may be more practical in their needs.\nYou can easily admire your Capricorn and love him or her with great loyalty. Problems can arise if your Venus is in Aries or Gemini, as your values may be quite different. Also, if your Moon is in Aries or Libra, compatibility may be more elusive.\nYour success here occurs best within the format of a well-defined relationship where everything is spelled out for both of you. This smoothly-running partnership can achieve stability in the real world and can bring a heightened sense of ambition into your life.\n"}
