{"content":"Your sign is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty, connecting you to your senses. You Taurus folks often have pleasant voices and yet you say what you mean. Your Gemini partner is ruled by Mercury, the messenger planet, which is associated with the breath, the spoken word, and all forms of language. Together, you two can find immense pleasure in sharing and communicating about the arts and may enchant each other with your different styles of creative expertise.\nYou are more attracted to sensual creativity, including music, massage and art forms that impact both sight and touch. On the other hand, your Gemini partner may gravitate more toward expression through words, poetry, riddles, and lighthearted play. Both of you enjoy the colorful and vibrant scenes of nature and would most likely enjoy the splendor of parks and outdoor theater.\nThis relationship is easier if you were born with the Moon or Mars in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius). Without the Moon or other planets in your chart in air signs, you may find that your Gemini lover is too flighty and changeable for your tastes. On the other hand, this relationship can bring movement and excitement into you life. In fact, this can be a nice match up if you are willing to stretch yourself beyond your physical comfort zones and move into the Gemini's mental world of words and ideas.\n"}
