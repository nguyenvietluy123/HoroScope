{"content":"Your conventional ways are certainly going to be tested by the radical and inventive antics of your Aquarian friend. You prefer physical down-home comfort and don't like your senses rattled by uncertainty. Unfortunately, you may be jolted and surprised by the eccentric ways of Aquarius.\nYou can be a soothing influence on your partner, for your earth can ground out the airy Aquarius. You are each more set in your ways than is at first apparent, as you are both fixed signs. When conflicts arise, your stubbornness is matched by your lover's unusual tactics -- including the sometimes difficult to accept realization that he or she knows everything. Let's face it: Aquarius is prone to mental arrogance, a trait intolerable to your simple and down-to-earth approach.\nAnother problem is that in your Aquarian's eyes, you are apt to become lazy and self-indulgent -- character flaws he or she just will not succumb to. Of course, other planetary placements can change the compatibility picture quite dramatically making this combination outlast all the others. For example, if the Moon or Mars in your chart is in any air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), compatibility is enhanced.\nLoving kindness, tolerance, and understanding go a long way toward making this relationship a success.\n"}
