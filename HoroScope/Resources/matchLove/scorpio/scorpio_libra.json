{"content":"You enjoy the seclusion of peaceful surroundings, which can help soothe your passions. You are private in your romantic and home life-often remaining cautious and reserved, even secretive, in the early stages of intimacy. It can take you a fair amount of time before allowing another to enter into the deeper regions of your soul.\nYour Libra lover can add an artistic refinement to your environment and can help you find ways to balance your head and your heart. He or she will probably be more socially oriented than you, approaching life from an intellectually based set of sensibilities. You, on the other hand, feel things without necessarily putting words to them. Libra uses language and actions to create pleasantness, and as such makes for an excellent host or hostess.\nThe question is: do you want someone to make things nice? Or do you want someone who can engage your tumultuous passions at the deepest levels of experience? If you have Venus in Libra, compatibility is increased. If your Moon is in any air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), you will be more accepting of your partner's artistic gifts.\nEven without this support from other planets, Libra can be a suitable match for you. They are able to create a refined atmosphere that exudes enchantment and magnetism. You thrive in these surroundings, for this tranquil and satisfying home becomes a base that allows you open your heart to the love and beauty around you.\nIf you allow, your lovely Libra can lead you into a more gentle way of living, while you return sincere and lasting love to your mate. Together you can share a deep and abiding trust from which you explore the virtues of pleasure and the finer things in life.\n"}
