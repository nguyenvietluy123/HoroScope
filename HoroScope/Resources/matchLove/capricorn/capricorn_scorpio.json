{"content":"You tend to hold in your emotions and may not be keen on disclosing your personal thoughts. Therefore, you naturally respect the personal privacy needs of those around you and tend to function best when secure boundaries are defined in your life.\nScorpios can have the integrity and honesty you seek, even if they seem secretive at times. They will tell the truth, but often not unless you ask. You can work and love well with a Scorpio, for they also keep their thoughts and feelings private, often preferring the quiet sanctuary of their own mind.\nYour Scorpio lover is intense and passionate, maybe more than you've bargained for, but he or she has a powerful sensuality that you find pleasing. Although you may not be inclined to display outward modes of affection, your sex drive can be quite strong and in Scorpio you've found someone who can go the distance with you.\nIf however, your Venus is in physically detached Aquarius, problems may surface in this area. A water sign Moon in your birth chart will increase long term compatibility.\nThe two of you should have a trustworthy union-drawing strong people to you as friends and associates. You'll work well together in any endeavor as both of you are tenacious and highly focused when it comes to achieving your individual or mutual goals. You may create a deeply passionate relationship that gives you each what you need, while at the same time creating a stable home for you and your family.\n"}
