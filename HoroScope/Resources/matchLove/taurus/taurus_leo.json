{"content":"You and your Leo partner are two of the four \"fixed signs\" of the zodiac, meaning you are less yielding and more stubborn than other astrological sun signs. There can be trouble because of this factor, especially when you and your Leo partner clash over how best to get your personal needs met and your individual styles of expressing love. You can be possessive and bull-headed and your lover can become jealous and needy.\nYou both have simplistic childlike tendencies that can prove to be detrimental in this pairing. You must aim high together to overcome the petty fears and emotions that can overwhelm the trust and love you have for each other.\nYou have to learn how to take turns being flexible. At times, you may get frustrated by your partner's self-centeredness, but if you tolerate his or her different style, you can be highly physical and quite romantic together. If you have Venus in Aries or the Moon in any fire sign (Aries, Leo or Sagittarius), this can sufficiently ease potential conflicts.\n Ultimately, the key is in learning early on how to sustain an enduring attitude of love and respect for your Lion. If you can do this, the two of you can endure hardships, share fun times and take on the world with zest and determination.\n"}
