{"content":"You are cautious in communication and usually choose your words with care and consideration. You Goats can be closed and conservative, especially in the early stages of a relationship, with little desire to expose your emotional vulnerability.\nGeminis, on the other hand, are associated, or ruled by, the communication planet Mercury, and tend to be very talkative and spontaneous with their words and ideas. They do have a tendency to be rational and mental in their approach to life-making them more attuned to your ways.\nBut the differences in your day-to-day communication patterns can be too much to overcome to make this relationship work, unless your chart has the Moon or Mars in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius). Even with an airy Moon or Mars, you tend to be methodical and slow to share internal thoughts, while your partner seems to be clever, mentally quick and carefree enough to speak aloud many visions and ideas.\nAllow for these basic differences, and by honoring the speaking skills of your Gemini, he or she can open wide your doors of communication, paving a path to deeper meaning from interpersonal relationships and increased self-awareness. Meanwhile, your partner can benefit from the stability and security that you bring to the team.\nIf your noisy Gemini lover can learn how to tone down some of the chatter when your need quiet space, this can be a workable union.\n"}
