{"content":"When two of the twelve astrological signs are opposite one another on the zodiacal wheel, they act like mirrors, each reflecting traits and attributes that the other sign needs. Opposites attract and it is not uncommon to find many couples who share sign oppositions.\nYou tend to be conservative with your emotions, which can make you seem stern or strict. You are of a hard-working breed, which prefers to be in the company of intelligent, well-informed individuals who carry respect and status.\nYou meet up with a Cancer, who is wired with an emotional constitution that is caring, nurturing, warm, and sensitive. You seem so different from each other. You are drawn to the outer world of career and success. He or she is drawn to the inner worlds of home and family.\nTogether, you can make quite a team, covering both ends of the spectrum. Your lover may be quite changeable in the rhythm of daily moods and can display emotions more overtly than most signs.\nAdditionally, if you have the Moon, Venus or Mars in water signs (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), you'll be more able to meet your hard-shelled Crab in a softer and more vulnerable manner.\nTogether you'll both need to adjust to each other with delicate candor and awareness. You stand to learn the virtues of the feeling world, and can find a genuine way to incorporate your emotions into the structure of family, friends and work. Your emotionally attuned lover can learn the value of objectivity and become skillful at monitoring his or her moodiness so as not to overwhelm you with trivial insecurities.\nThis is a powerful common match-up, offering plenty of growing room for both of you individually and together as a team.\n"}
