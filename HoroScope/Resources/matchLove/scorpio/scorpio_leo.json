{"content":"Chances are that you are an accomplished individual who needs to feel as though you are productive and respected within your sphere. You take pride in your efforts to meet the needs of the community and are often employed in jobs that are risky, dangerous and intense, requiring specific skills combined with courage. There are many police officers, firefighters, and doctors who are born under the influence of Scorpio.\nLeos are also deeply sincere in their efforts, but they tend to be more grandiose and flamboyant in the outer world, sometimes grabbing the limelight away from less showy signs. If your Leo underestimates your value by stealing attention or making light of your worth, you will find it intolerable and probably cut off the relationship.\nYou and your Leo lover are both fixed signs, and therefore can be quite stubborn in your own individual ways. Unless you have the Moon or Mars in a fire sign, you may see your partner as someone who wastes energy on the wrong things.\n Even with other compatible planets, this relationship is fraught with tension. You'll surely need to compromise in significant ways and learn to respect each other's very different characters. If you can accept each other, there is a high level of loyalty in each of you that can make this become a lasting union.\n"}
