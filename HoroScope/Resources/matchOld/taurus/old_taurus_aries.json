{"content":"Taurus-Aries Compatibility \nAn Arian is always in haste and a Taurian takes his/her own time to understand a situation in depth. The Aries individual falters frequently and his Taurus counterpart reacts with \"I told you so\" attitude. This can act as a spanner in the works as far as the loveCompatibility between both the signs is concerned. To make this relationship work well each one of the duo has to respect the viewpoint of the other. \n\nTaurus Man and Aries Woman \nA Taurus man is a home bird, while an Aries woman likes indulging in novel activities. He is stingy and she is extravagant. She is determined and audacious, he is practical and humble. The free spirit of an Aries woman gets confined by the seriousness of the Taurus man. The conflicts make an Aries-Taurus love match work hard to sustain. This match does have chances of succeeding provided the Taurus man respects the personal freedom of the Aries Woman and she in turn saves a penny.\n\nTaurus Woman and Aries Man \nFrom the astrological angle, the match between an Aries man and a Taurus woman is not perfect. Nagging and fighting may creep in after a few love cuddled days. The reason: he doesn't take life too seriously and she is too practical for his impulsive behaviour. His laid back nature will get on her nerves. She may desire to spend some time in only his company. But, he will feel trapped and then she will feel neglected.\n"}
