{"content":"You are practical, levelheaded and more overt with your emotions and needs than the quiet and sometimes moody Scorpio. Both of you are fixed signs and can be stubborn, tending to brood when you cannot have your way.\nYou are less likely to hold a grudge or exhibit silent resentment than your Scorpion lover. Instead, you may try to push your way into his or her psyche. Your determination, however, won't wear down the powerful feelings of your partner.\nYou tend to be simplistic in your physical needs, while Scorpio's sensuality and sexuality is more complicated than you can imagine. As opposite signs of the zodiac, you are attracted to one another and can be extremely sexy together. If the placement of other planets in your chart -- especially the Moon or Mars -- is in any water sign (Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces), then you are more likely to be willing to engage the intensity of Scorpio's feelings.\nYour steadiness is tested by Scorpio, yet his or her strong magnetism will entice you to hold on to the dream of \"forever\" with great hope and fortitude.\n"}
