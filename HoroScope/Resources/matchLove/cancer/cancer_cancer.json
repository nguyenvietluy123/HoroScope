{"content":"Cancer is Latin for \"Crab.\" You watery Crabs are highly emotional, ruled by the changeable Moon. You tend to be nurturing, caring, and affectionate when in love. Regardless of your sex, you have a maternal instinct that offers love and shelter to those you love. Most Cancers focus on family, home, and children, and may even have a career that includes this type of service.\nWhen two Crabs unite, you will be attuned to each other's emotional currents with your hypersensitive awareness. You may not be accustomed to getting your own needs met, so it will be odd to have someone mirroring the same kind of devotion back to you and caring for you in the loving way that you care for others. In some ways, this can prove to be challenging. You long for this comfort, but you cannot easily accept it.\nYou will have a very homey and somewhat traditional house with plenty of blankets, tissues (for tears) and cozy furniture. You will love to snuggle and be physically and emotionally close. You'll make good parents, but can be overprotective with each other and your kids. You may need some coaxing to get you out of the house and go on adventures, unless the placement of your Moon or Mars indicates otherwise.\n"}
