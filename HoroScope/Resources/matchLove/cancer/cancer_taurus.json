{"content":"You are a \"home alone\" kind of person, and with sensual and earthy Taurus, not only do you get along, but you are likely to enjoy staying \"home alone\" together. Your Taurus is like Ferdinand the Bull. He or she loves to graze in the fields of your emotionally rich and private world, nibbling at all the goodies you lovingly prepare in your kitchen. Taurus, also a good cook, adores home-baked breads, cookies, and muffins.\nThe two of you nest well together and can get so cozy and happy in the confines of your own home that you just may need some coaxing from friends and family to get you out to join in social events.\nIf either or both of you have the Moon in a fire sign, you may be more inclined to do things uninvited. No matter what sign your Moons are in, you two can create a pleasant home together that has an inviting and comfortable flair. The stable and well-grounded Taurus has an easy time adjusting to your varying moods and can provide a safe foundation for the ebb and flow of your emotional tides.\n"}
