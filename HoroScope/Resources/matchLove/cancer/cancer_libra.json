{"content":"You are very attracted to the refined beauty of the Libra personality and may fling yourself into the life of the aesthetic, Venus-ruled Libra without your usual caution and reserve. You act through feeling and gut instinct, not complex thought and lofty ideals. Libra, on the other hand, acts through high standards of intellect and choreographed life planning. In this way, you and your Libra lover are very different.\nEven though you worry about it, you tend to make up your mind and then try to hold to your plan. Libra has a difficult time with this and vacillates while seeking to balance each decision with discernible truth and harmony. You are a water sign and live by your feelings. Your deep sincerity and need for tender support may find your Libra partner, in the long haul, to be dry and emotionally unavailable, unless the Moon in your chart is in an air sign.\nEven with other planetary placements that add to your compatibility, there is an underlying tension based upon differing styles of living. Your Libra lover can become disapproving of your whimsical moods and your emotional displays of affection. The chord of harmony you will need to pluck is based on unconditional love and humor, and with that in mind, you can make a lovely home together.\n"}
