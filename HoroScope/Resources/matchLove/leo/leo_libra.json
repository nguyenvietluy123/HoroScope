{"content":"Your charismatic personality is outwardly bright and naturally endowed with humor, drama and colorful dress. You love beauty, ornate costumes and entertaining friends and family with your generosity. Libra is the detached connoisseur of good taste and prefers refined modes of decor.\nHowever, you both admire the qualities of each other's artistic skill. Your Libra lover may not fully approve of your many masks and antics. On the other hand you just might find your classy Libra a bit too stuffy. You jump in and get your hands dirty, but your partner would rather coach with their artful eye from the sidelines.\nYou will have many things in common and can share theater, museums and art classes. You will probably have distinctive styles that are quite different from each other. If Venus is in Libra in your chart or in Leo in your partner's chart, your styles may be more compatible.\nYour dress preference may serve as a metaphor for other aspects of behaviors and life patterns that distinguish the two of you from each other. Even with these differences, you can find contentment and happiness with a gracious Libra for a mate.\n"}
