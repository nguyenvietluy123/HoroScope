{"content":"You are an idealist, but you do like to put your ideas into practical action. You are, after all, naturally goal-oriented and feel best when moving toward the achievement of projects and ambitions. You are easily inspired by Aquarius, with their futuristic lean, eclectic inventiveness and intuitive brilliant out-of-the-box approach to life.\nYour Aquarius lover is ingenious and most certainly a unique individual. With them, you feel like your life adventure is on the cutting edge of the culture.\nThis is a partnership of air mixed with your fire. Aquarius fans the flames of your big ideas with unusual excitement of their own. The two of you can be terrific friends even if it doesn't become hot romantically. If you do choose to live together, a lack of daily routine can make it difficult to plant your feet firmly on the ground.\n Together, yours is an intellectual world of ideas, even if you tend to be more physical. And herein is a second difference. Your partner must be willing to engage in the big outdoors and the physical aspects of love or you'll lose interest pretty quickly.\nIf your Venus is in Scorpio, your emotional intensity may be at odds with your lover's easy sense of detachment, but with your Moon in an air sign (Gemini, Libra or Aquarius), compatibility is increased.\nTogether you two communicate exciting ideas, sometimes in unusual ways. You stimulate each other and enhance one another's intuitive flashes of brilliance. You are a progressive duo and will probably enjoy and making each and every moment count.\n"}
