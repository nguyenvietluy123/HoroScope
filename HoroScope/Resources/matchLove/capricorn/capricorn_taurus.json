{"content":"On the surface, this seems like the proverbial \"match made in heaven.\" When you meet up with a Taurus, you find someone who is also concerned with practical down-to-earth matters, although there are also differences. You see life as a mountain and strive to overcome any obstacles that may prevent you from reaching the summit. You build your life on the premise that integrity and hard work ultimately create success.\nYour Taurus lover may be as determined as you to succeed, but success for them is not about reaching the top. It is having material security. While your partner may want to spend money on nice furniture, art, linens, music, food and other creature comforts, you choose to be financially frugal and conservative when it comes to purchasing. You worry about your stability and would rather do with less when the sun is shining in order to be ready for a rainy day.\nStill, Taurus is a suitable partner for you, and shares your values related to quality of life. However, while your sign is associated with austere Saturn, your Taurus partner is more connected with Venus, the planet of sensual enjoyment. If, however, Venus in your chart is in fiery Sagittarius or eclectic Aquarius, you may also appreciate spending money on material possessions.\nSince you probably prefer to be in the company of astute and financially stable friends, you may be able to incorporate the spending habits of your Taurus mate as long as he or she helps to create an environment that you approve of and admire. Romantically, you both can have strong sexual needs, and although somewhat conservative, can be extremely expressive. You both adore the steadfast tradition of old buildings, stone, brick, or solid houses set in natural surroundings, and long lasting virtues-and this becomes a metaphor for what you seek within this stable relationship.\n"}
