{"content":"You are the quick change artist known for your restless mind and clever wit. Your Capricorn lover is steady, conservative and not inclined toward lighthearted cocktail party banter. Your character is very different than the Goat. Whereas you are playful and childlike, searching for ways to communicate and share ideas with others, your Goat is serious and hardworking, preferring to focus on tasks and goals. Bridging the gap between these two, however, can be tremendously rewarding.\nYour role in the relationship is to help your Capricorn lighten up the load of everyday life with your usual good cheer and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, your partner can bring practical and steadfast organization into your life.\nIf Venus or Mars in your chart is compatible with your Capricorn friend's chart, then you will be more receptive to creating a strong foundation between the two of you.\nQuiet Capricorn may need to give plenty of attention to the talkative Gemini, learning to appreciate candid conversation and a playful approach to communication.\nIt will probably be easier for you to allow for the diverse qualities in each other, but if your Goat can loosen up, it is possible for the two of you to merge and join forces, creating a productive relationship with plenty of room for growth and mutual respect.\n"}
