{"content":"You Aquarians are broad minded and humanistic in your altruistic dealings with groups, organizations and individuals. You strive to bring a greater harmony to world affairs through your keen alertness and concern for others. Your awareness is not an emotional understanding as much as it is a rational and intelligent observance of the world around you.\nMeanwhile, Pisces, the last sign of the zodiac, is a kaleidoscope of intuitive understanding and compassion. Pisces folks are aware of the troubles in the world-at-large and carry this perspective forward with sensitivity, gentle care and empathy. But they are not as intellectually oriented as you may be. This represents a basic difference of styles.\nYou are motivated by ideas and concepts. He or she is motivated by compassion and wordless feelings. If you can get past this difference, together you are inspired to advance the mind and heart of humanity. You will share a concern for the welfare of others and may become connected through volunteer programs, charity work or non-profit organizations.\nYou'll need to learn how to cherish and incorporate the imaginative and intuitive gifts of your Pisces into your sometimes detached intellectual framework. If Mercury or Venus in your chart is in Pisces, this will be much easier for you to do. In fact, if the Moon in your chart is in any water sign, you'll have an increased chance of making this relationship work.\nYour lover will, in turn, need to learn how to communicate in rational and non-emotional ways at times-even if this is counter-intuitive-in order to help you understand his or her needs. If you two can achieve this balance, a emotionally and intellectually satisfying relationship can endure hardship and obstacles.\n"}
